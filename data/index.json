      "abstract": "Identifying influential nodes in social networks − by determining the most effective and efficient set of primary users − is a crucial task for maximizing the spread of influence. The competitive world of social networks and the variety of services they provide have persuaded users to apply for the membership of several networks. This situation makes involvement of the shared individuals across multiple social networks essential for the effective dissemination of information. In this paper, we introduce a community-based entropic method to identify influential nodes in multiple social networks, taking into account the effect of shared users. The proposed method, titled IM2-SE, focuses on calculating a total structural entropy for each node. This structural entropy is defined as the weighted sum of the structural entropies of the node in the networks and in the communities, it belongs to. The structural entropy of a node is based on Tsallis entropy considering both local and global structures of the network, and it utilizes the degree of centrality and betweenness centrality. Then, the nodes with the highest total structural entropy are identified as the influential nodes. The empirical evaluation of the proposed method on the real-world datasets including homogeneous and heterogeneous networks, demonstrates its superior performance to the baseline methods. Furthermore, the impact of the shared nodes between networks in identifying the influential nodes has been examined, revealing that up to 50% of the identified influential nodes are the shared nodes between specific networks."

      "abstract": "COVID-19 poses a complex and unprecedented challenge to public health and society, requiring scientific efforts to understand, model, diagnose, and control the disease. The integration of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with epidemiological models offers a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of infectious diseases and developing effective strategies to control and mitigate their impact. In this study, we develop a novel hybrid approach to modelling and forecasting the dynamics and the demand for healthcare resources. We take advantage of the concept of PINNs to capture the dynamics of infectious diseases, estimate key parameters, and unobserved states in the ability of the model, using the neural network to integrate physical laws directly into the learning process of a modified compartmental model. We also make use of the strength of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to combine data generated by a PINN and lagged covariates of target variables to forecast demand from the intensive care unit demand using different variations of RNN models. The results indicate that our proposed hybrid framework is highly effective in capturing the dynamics of the pandemic and providing insight into the dynamics of the disease."

Since it is nondeterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard, most algorithms designed for the problem follow metaheuristic strategies to find high-quality solutions in affordable time but with no optimality guarantee. In this paper, a variant of the iterated greedy algorithm is developed for the problem. It adopts the idea of increasing the search radius used in variable neighbourhood search by increasing the number of reconstructed components at each iteration with no improved solution, where the amount of the increase is determined dynamically based on the quality of the current solution. We demonstrate that the new algorithm significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms for this problem on standard datasets."

      "abstract": "Integrating renewable energy sources into the power distribution grid challenges protection system operation, leading to protection blinding when circuit breakers fail to trip due to fault current contribution from these sources. Communication-based adaptive protection can address this issue, but communication system components like sensors can fail. This research proposes a genetic algorithm-based approach to optimally place redundant sensors, minimizing protection blinding under communication uncertainty within a redundancy budget. The fault tolerance, measured by a new metric called redundancy degree, reflects the number of redundant components deployed. Results demonstrate the algorithm’s effectiveness in optimizing redundant sensor locations, reducing system costs, and improving fault tolerance. For the system and scenarios investigated, an average of 60% redundant sensors are relocated, reducing the average protection trip time by 36.65% compared to a baseline approach that does not consider communication uncertainty. This encourages incorporating communication component failure considerations in power system planning."

      "abstract": "This paper addresses the workload placement problem in the edge-fog-cloud continuum. We model the edge fog-cloud computing continuum as a multi-agent framework consisting of networked resource supply and demand agents. Inspired by the swarm intelligence behavior of the ant colony optimization, we propose a workload scheduler for the arriving demand agents to increase local resource utilization and reduce communication costs without relying on a centralized scheduler. Like the ants, the demand agents will release pheromones on the resource agent to indicate the available resources. The next arriving demand agent will most probably choose a neighbor, following the pheromone value and communication cost. The framework’s performance is evaluated in terms of local resource utilization, dependency on fog and cloud, and communication cost. We compare these metrics for the ant-inspired algorithm with random and greedy algorithms.The simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm inspired by swarm intelligence can increase resource utilization at the edge and reduce the dependency on higher layers, while also decreasing the communication cost for the task of resource allocation"

      "abstract": "Protection blinding is a challenging issue in renewables-penetrated distribution grids and refers to a situation where a circuit breaker may not trip due to fault current contribution from distributed generation. This research addresses how the distributed generation location and capacity impact the operation of the circuit breaker in terms of the response time of the circuit breakers. The relative electrical distances of the faults and distributed generation to the circuit breakers are considered. The impact of distributed generation capacity considering the fault location is characterized using a new index called the heterogeneity index. The electrical distance between distributed generations and circuit breakers and the electrical distance between fault and circuit breaker is considered by a second new index called the electrical distance ratio. Data analysis on simulation results shows that these indices capture the phenomena of protection blinding caused by distributed generation. Results show that a higher distributed generation penetration and faults that are electrically further away from a circuit breaker show severe cases of protection blinding captured by the indices. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how these indices can identify the worst impacted locations in the distribution grid. A key result is that protection blinding does not necessarily occur solely due to the presence of distributed generation between a circuit breaker and a fault, but is dependent on factors such as distributed generation location in the distribution grid, fault level, fault level distribution across the generation units and fault location."

In interaction-CASCADE, the total incurred overload after each component failure is the same as the CASCADE; however, the overload transfers to the out neighbors of the failed component given by the interaction graph. We first assume that the component’s initial loads are independent of their out- and in-degrees in the interaction graph and show that even though the process’s dynamics depend on the interaction graphs’ structure, the critical load beyond which the probability of total failure is significant does not change. We then discuss that assigning the lighter loads to components with higher in-degrees can shift the minimum critical load to higher values. Simulation results for random Erdős-Rényi and power-law degree distributed are provided and discussed."

      "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MS) is a genetic disorder often associated with the development of aortic aneurysms, leading to severe vascular complications. The progression of this condition is intricately linked to hemodynamic factors such as wall shear stress (WSS) and von Mises stress, as abnormal distributions can contribute to thrombus formation, endothelial damage, and the worsening of aneurysmal conditions. In this study, six vascular models were analyzed: four representing diseased aortas with Marfan syndrome aneurysms and two healthy aortic models for comparison. The models were sourced from Vascular Model Repository, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted using a Newtonian fluid model and the shear stress transport (SST) k- ω turbulent transitional model to evaluate WSS and von Mises stress. Fluid-structure interaction was employed to incorporate vessel wall interaction, and pulsatile inlet velocity profiles were used to simulate physiological blood flow, capturing time-dependent hemodynamic variations. The results revealed significant differences between healthy and diseased aortic models. In healthy models, WSS was uniformly distributed, with values consistently below 40 Pa, reflecting stable vascular conditions. Conversely, the diseased models exhibited highly non-uniform WSS distributions, with notably lower values in aneurysmal regions, contributing to thrombus formation, with elevated WSS in areas like the carotid and subclavian arteries due to geometric and hemodynamic complexities. The von Mises stress analysis identified regions of heightened rupture risk, particularly on the superior side of case MS 1 , where both von Mises stress and WSS reached their highest values among all cases. Physics-informed neural networks demonstrated strong agreement with CFD results while significantly reducing computational cost, highlighting their potential for real-time clinical applications. These findings underscore the critical role of hemodynamic factors in aneurysm progression and rupture risk, offering valuable insights for optimizing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in vascular diseases."

The implementation of simulated annealing (SA) as a hyperparameter tuning method produced certain model structures and good results in terms of prediction accuracy. Our findings show that the LSTM-based models (LSTM_SA), achieved the lowest mean average error (MAE), outperforming other architectures used in this study. The results of this study show the potential of DL models to forecast the demand for resources and could help inform the distribution of hospitalisation resources in England during the COVID-19 pandemic."

A mathematical model is used to solve problem statements drawn from assumptions. Optimizing the allocation of resources can be achieved by using algorithms to optimise the cost of distributing resources in order to control a pandemic. The goal of this research would be to find the most cost-effective algorithm, utilizing all operational research methodologies.

      "abstract": "The emotion–cause pair extraction (ECPE) task is to simultaneously extract emotions and causes as pairs (EC-pairs) from documents, which is important for natural language processing. Previous research tackled this task via a two-step approach, which first predicts separately the emotion and cause clauses, and then pairs them up by using a binary classifier. However, such a two-step approach may suffer from the possible propagation of errors, and it neglects the interaction between emotions and causes. In this article, an end-to-end double-graph method with relational enhancement (DGRE) is proposed to stimulate two relationship modes among clauses, i.e., semantic dependence and logical dependence. First, two united graph encoders are established to embed the semantic dependence into the representation of clauses and pairs. The first encoder is built on graph attention networks (GATs) for clause-level representation, the result of which is used by a relational graph convolutional network (RGCN) for the refinement of pair-level representation. Aiming to enhance the fitting ability of logical dependence, the emotion-type classification task is introduced into the multitask learning framework of GATs, which can effectively distinguish the logical relations between clauses according to their emotion types. Moreover, seven types of dependence relations have been designed for the node connections in RGCN, which emphasize the contextual interaction and clustering among neighboring nodes. Experiments on a benchmark Chinese corpus demonstrate that the proposed DGRE approach could effectively establish the communication mechanism between clauses and pairs from multiple perspectives, and comparisons with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models well validate its effectiveness."

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a pivotal role in Industry 4.0, with predictive maintenance (PdM) emerging as a core application for improving operational efficiency by reducing unplanned downtime and extending asset life. Despite these advancements, the black-box nature of AI models remains a significant barrier to adoption, as industry stakeholders require systems that are both transparent and trustworthy. This study presents a systematic literature review examining how human-in-the-loop explainable AI (HITL-XAI) approaches can enhance the effectiveness and adoption of AI systems in PdM contexts. This review followed the PRISMA methodology, employing predefined search strings across Scopus, ProQuest, and EBSCO databases. Sixty-three peer-reviewed journal articles, published between 2019 and early 2025, were included in the final analysis. The selected studies span various domains, including industrial manufacturing, energy, and transportation, with findings synthesized through both descriptive and thematic analyses. A key gap identified is the limited empirical exploration of generative AI (GenAI) in improving the usability, interpretability, and trustworthiness of HITL-XAI systems in PdM applications. This review outlines actionable insights for integrating explainability and GenAI into existing rule-based PdM systems to support more adaptive and reliable maintenance strategies. Ultimately, the findings underscore the importance of designing HITL-XAI systems that not only demonstrate high model performance but are also effectively aligned with operational workflows and the cognitive needs of maintenance personnel."

      "abstract": "Modelling the hydro-morphodynamics of mangrove environments poses significant challenges due to their complex geometry, dynamic vegetation-water interactions, and limited in situ measurements. Traditional numerical models struggle in such settings due to high computational cost, the need for extensive mesh generation, and difficulties in assimilating heterogeneous data sources. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a hybrid Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) framework that integrates governing physical laws, satellite-derived vegetation data, and outputs from high- resolution Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of the Sundarbans mangrove system. The proposed hybrid PINN model incorporates shallow water flow and sediment transport equations into the loss function and uses a temporal causality weighting mechanism to improve convergence in time-dependent domains. Model outputs include elevation, flow velocity, and suspended sediment concentration. The model is trained using a small subset of CFD simulation data and validated against a traditional finite element (FE) solver and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) baseline. The proposed hybrid PINNs model achieved RMSE values in the range of 10 −2 for elevation and velocity and 10 −3 for sediment concentration, significantly outperforming the CNN model, particularly in generalising to unseen time steps. Compared to the FE model, the proposed framework achieved a five-fold reduction in training time (24 h vs. 5 days) and supports inference within seconds, enabling near real-time predictions. The mesh-free structure of the model, combined with its physics-regularised learning, also facilitates adaptation to other coastal or mangrove systems governed by similar dynamics. This hybrid approach offers a robust, generalisable surrogate for high-fidelity coastal simulations in data-scarce and computationally demanding environments."

      "abstract": "Dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia, is a progres- sive brain disorder that disrupts memory, thinking, and behavior, with early diagnosis being critical for effective intervention. This study examines the alteration of brain activity caused by dementia by analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals using an infor- mation geometry method known as information rate, which captures the evolving pat- terns of brain signals over time rather than relying on static averages. This method is applied across standard EEG frequency bands – delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma – in participants with dementia and healthy controls. The characteristics of the distribu- tion of information rate are studied through the statistical moments (such as mean, vari- ance, skewness, and kurtosis) and Shannon entropy. The statistical comparisons are accessed using the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post-hoc analysis, and results are compared against a conventional average-base method using Jensen-Shannon distance. The results show that dynamic features of EEG signals – particularly in the theta, alpha, and beta bands – effectively distinguish Alzheimer’s patients from healthy individuals, while the Shannon entropy of signal dynamics in frontal region differentiates frontotem- poral dementia patients across the theta to gamma bands. Moreover, changes in the occipital region detected by information rate, but not by traditional method, further high- light the importance of capturing temporal variability. The method also successfully dis- tinguishes individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment from healthy controls, which con- ventional analysis failed to achieve. These results suggest that analyzing the dynamics properties of the brain signals provides a more sensitive and informative approach for identifying and distinguishing various forms of dementia."

      "abstract": "The prospect of future treatment warrants the development of cost-effective screening for Alzheimer's disease (AD). A promising candidate in this regard is electroencephalography (EEG), as it is one of the most economic imaging modalities. Recent efforts in EEG analysis have shifted towards leveraging spatial information, employing novel frameworks such as graph signal processing or graph neural networks. Here, we investigate the importance of spatial information relative to spectral or temporal information by varying the proportion of each dimension for AD classification. To do so, we systematically test various dimension resolution configurations on two routine EEG datasets. Our findings show that spatial information is more important than temporal information and equally valuable as spectral information. On the larger second dataset, substituting spectral with spatial information even led to an increase of 1.1% in accuracy, which emphasises the importance of spatial information for EEG-based AD classification. We argue that our resolution-based feature extraction has the potential to improve AD classification specifically, and multivariate signal classification generally.Clinical relevance - This study proposes balancing the spectral, temporal and spatial feature resolution to improve EEGbased diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Digital health is a critical driver of quality, safety, and efficiency in health care. However, poor quality of clinical information in digital health technologies (DHTs) can compromise the quality and safety of care. The Clinical Information Quality (CLIQ) framework was developed, based on a systemic review of literature and an international eDelphi study, as a tool to assess the quality of clinical information in DHTs. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to assess the applicability, internal consistency, and construct validity of the CLIQ framework. METHODS: This study was conducted as a cross-sectional survey of health care professionals across the United Kingdom who regularly use SystmOne electronic health records. Participants were invited through emails and social media platforms. The CLIQ questionnaire was administered as a web-based survey. Spearman correlation coefficients were computed to investigate the linear relationship between the dimensions in the CLIQ framework. The Cronbach α coefficients were computed to assess the internal consistency of the global scale (ie, CLIQ framework) and the subscales (ie, the informativeness, availability, and usability categories). Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess the extent to which the survey data supported the construct validity of the CLIQ framework. RESULTS: A total of 109 health care professionals completed the survey, of which two-thirds (67, 61.5%) were doctors and a quarter (26, 23.9%) were nurses or advanced nurse practitioners. Overall, the CLIQ dimensions had good quality scores except for portability, which had a modest score. The inter-item correlations were all positive and not likely due to chance. The Cronbach α coefficient for the overall CLIQ framework was 0.89 (95% CI 0.85-0.92). The confirmatory factor analysis provided a modest support for the construct validity of the CLIQ framework with the comparative fit index of 0.86 and standardized root mean square residual of 0.08. CONCLUSIONS: The CLIQ framework demonstrated a high reliability and a modest construct validity. The CLIQ framework offers a pragmatic approach to assessing the quality of clinical information in DHTs and could be applied as part of information quality assurance systems in health care settings to improve quality of health information."

      "abstract": "Introduction: Governments create policies to address societal needs and then assess their effectiveness through policy metrics. The UK Rare Diseases Framework and its England Rare Diseases Action Plans aim to improve the lives of people with lived experience of rare diseases and their carers. Reaching these goals requires more effective engagement with those least likely to interact with NHS services. This paper outlines a protocol to identify relevant high-level policy metrics while engaging underserved and underrepresented groups. Methods and Analysis: A long list of candidate metrics for the 36 Actions linked to the four Priority Areas of the Framework was compiled from government logic models. The list was discussed in three workshops, and irrelevant, ambiguous, or time-irrelevant metrics were removed. Additional metrics were identified through an evidence review and expert opinion. In the first round of a two-round eDelphi study, shortlisted metrics will be grouped into the four Priority Areas: Faster Diagnosis, Increased Healthcare Professional Awareness, Better Care Coordination, and Improved Access to Specialist Care, Treatment, and drugs. An eDelphi panel of 50 people living with rare disease or their carers, as well as 50 professional stakeholders, will rate each metric on a 1-9 scale. The sample size allows for 20% attrition. Consensus for inclusion or exclusion will be based on 70% agreement (7-9 for 'very valuable', 1-3 for 'not valuable'), with fewer than 15% rating the metric at the opposite end of the scale. Metrics will be included or excluded if consensus is reached in both groups; otherwise, they will remain under consideration in Round 2. In Round 1, eDelphi participants may propose additional metrics, which will be included in Round 2. After two rounds, a final set of policy metrics will be selected. Any discrepancies in Round 2 ratings will be explored through further research. Ethics and Dissemination: The Coventry University Group Research Ethics Committee has approved the study (P183377). The results will be disseminated to people with lived experience of rare disease and professional stakeholders through conferences, events, and newsletters and submitted to a peer-reviewed journal. If adopted, the identified metrics will inform decision-making on rare disease policies in England and beyond.

      "abstract": "Introduction: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has significant impact on depression, anxiety, psychological wellbeing and health-related quality of life. We co-created a theory-led, evidence-based, 6-week, digital self-management and positive wellbeing intervention (Hope PCOS), delivered to UK adults.  We tested the intervention’s potential to improve mental health and wellbeing outcomes and its acceptability and usability for adults living with PCOS. Methods: This was a mixed methods feasibility randomised controlled trial conducted online, with a pre-post, waitlist-controlled design. Primary outcomes were recruitment, completion (≥ 3 intervention sessions) and follow-up rates. At baseline, participants reported demographic information, PCOS symptoms, depression (Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)), anxiety ((Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7)), polycystic ovary syndrome health-related quality of life (PCOSQ-50), psychological wellbeing (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, WEMWBS) and self-efficacy (Self-Efficacy to Manage Chronic Disease Scale (SEMCD6)) before randomisation to an intervention group (IG) receiving the intervention immediately or a waitlist control group (CG) receiving the intervention 12 weeks later. PHQ-9, GAD-7, PCOSQ-50, WEMWBS and SEMDC6 were reassessed at 6 and 12 weeks. IG participants reported the usability of the digital intervention (system usability scale (SUS)) and acceptability via qualitative exit interviews. Results: Of 131 eligible, consented participants, 83% (N=109, age M=37.1, SD=8.6 years) completed baseline measures and were randomised to the IG (n=54) or the CG (n=55). Baseline clinical caseness was high for depression (n=77, 70.6%) and anxiety (n=78, 71.6 %). Twenty-one participants (39%) in the IG completed ≥3 intervention sessions. At 6-week follow-up, completion of secondary outcomes was n=32 (59%) for IG and n= 38 (69%) for CG; at 12 weeks, n=31 (57%) for IG and n= 38 (69%) for CG. Twelve IG participants took part in the exit interviews. Exploratory descriptive statistics suggest there were greater improvements in depression, anxiety, psychological wellbeing, self-efficacy and quality of life for the intervention group completers compared to the waitlist control group. SUS data and thematic analysis suggest the intervention was usable, acceptable, relevant and interesting. Participants reported experiences including feeling seen and valued, having the difficulties of lifestyle change acknowledged, and learning valuable lessons, particularly how to monitor and manage emotions, prioritise self-care and complete personal goals. Conclusions:  This novel intervention was rated as usable and acceptable, with potential for improving mental health and wellbeing outcomes. More research is needed to identify for whom the intervention is beneficial and on implementation in practice."

      "abstract": "This paper builds and extends on the authors' previous work related to the algorithmic tool, Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD), and one of its core applications, Real Quantifier Elimination (QE).  These topics are at the heart of symbolic computation and were first implemented in computer algebra systems decades ago, but have recently received renewed interest as part of the ongoing development of SMT solvers for non-linear real arithmetic. First, we consider the use of iterated univariate resultants in traditional CAD, and how this leads to inefficiencies, especially in the case of an input with multiple equational constraints.   We reproduce the workshop paper [Davenport & England, 2023], adding important clarifications to our suggestions first made there to make use of multivariate resultants in the projection phase of CAD.  We then consider an alternative approach to this problem first documented in [McCallum & Brown, 2009] which redefines the actual object under construction, albeit only in the case of two equational constraints.  We correct an unhelpful typo and provide a proof missing from that paper. We finish by revising the topic of how to deal with SMT or Real QE problems expressed using rational functions (as opposed to the usual polynomial ones) noting that these are often found in industrial applications.  We revisit a proposal made in [Uncu, Davenport and England, 2023] for doing this in the case of satisfiability, explaining why such an approach does not trivially extend to more complicated quantification structure and giving a suitable alternative."

      "abstract": "This study is part of a larger project focused on measuring, understanding, and improving student engagement in programming education. We investigate whether synthetic data generation can help identify at-risk students earlier in a small, imbalanced dataset from an introductory programming module. The analysis used anonymised records from 379 students, with 15% marked as failing, and applied several machine learning algorithms. The first experiments showed poor recall for the failing group. However, using synthetic data generation methods led to a significant improvement in performance. Our  results suggest that, when combined with synthetic data, machine learning can help identify at-risk students early in programming courses. This research lays the groundwork for validating and using these models with live student cohorts in the future, to allow for timely and effective interventions that can improve student outcomes. It also includes feature importance analysis to refine formative tasks. Overall, this study contributes to developing practical workflows that help detect disengagement early and improve student success in programming education."

Recent exploration-guided algorithms like NLSAT, NuCAD, and CAlC rely on CAD technology but reduce the computational effort heuristically. Single cell construction is a paradigm that is used in each of these algorithms.  The central property on which the CAD algorithm is based is called delineability. Recently, we introduced a weaker notion called projective delineability which can require fewer computations to guarantee, but needs to be applied carefully. This paper adapts the single cell construction for exploiting projective delineability and reports on experimental results."

The method was tested in OpenAI Gym's Mountain Car and Lunar Lander environments. Results show that these SINDy-based models can closely match the real environment's behavior while cutting down computational cost by 20–35%. With just 75 data points for Mountain Car and 1000 for Lunar Lander, the models achieved over 0.997 state-wise correlation, with very low prediction errors (as low as 3.11 × 10⁻⁶ for Mountain Car velocity and 1.42 × 10⁻⁶ for Lunar Lander position). RL agents trained in these simplified environments needed fewer steps to learn (65,075 vs. 100,000 for Mountain Car and 801,000 vs. 1,000,000 for Lunar Lander) and performed similarly to those trained in the full environments. This work offers a fast and accurate way to create interpretable models for use in model-based RL."

      "abstract": "Building control systems typically use either setpoint regulation, where controllers determine optimal setpoints for low-level systems, or direct actuator control, which bypasses the setpoint layer. Despite widespread hierarchical approaches, empirical evidence comparing these strategies remains limited. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of both paradigms using reinforcement learning (RL) with the Building Optimization Performance Test (BOPTEST) framework. We implement and compare: (1) setpoint-trained RL agents using PPO, DQN, and A2C algorithms, (2) direct actuation-controlled RL agents with identical algorithms, and (3) a conventional PI controller baseline. Experiments span two simulation environments (BESTEST Hydronic Heat Pump and BESTEST Air systems) with constant electricity pricing. Results demonstrate that setpoint regulation achieves near-perfect thermal comfort (> 99% discomfort reduction) with modest energy cost increases (4.8–5.0%), while direct actuator control offers smaller energy penalties (1.8–3.2%) with substantial comfort improvements (> 80% discomfort reduction). Most significantly, setpoint regulation consistently demonstrated faster learning, requiring 48–79% fewer training steps across algorithms and environments. The setpoint-trained approach also exhibited 38% lower control signal variance (measured as the standard deviation of actuator commands) over the 14-day testing period. These findings provide quantitative evidence supporting a two-level control architecture, where an RL agent optimizes setpoints for existing low-level controllers, while also identifying conditions where direct actuator control by an RL agent may be advantageous. Our research contributes valuable empirical insights for designing energy-efficient building control strategies using reinforcement learning, with setpoint regulation offering significant advantages in training efficiency and control stability."

      "abstract": "Objective: This paper aims to address the challenges in abstract screening within systematic reviews (SR) by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Methods: We employ LLM to prioritize candidate studies by aligning abstracts with the selection criteria outlined in an SR protocol. Abstract screening was transformed into a novel question-answering (QA) framework, treating each selection criterion as a question addressed by LLM. The framework involves breaking down the selection criteria into multiple questions, properly prompting LLM to answer each question, scoring and re-ranking each answer, and combining the responses to make nuanced inclusion or exclusion decisions. Results and Discussion: Large-scale validation was performed on the benchmark of CLEF eHealth 2019 Task 2: Technology-Assisted Reviews in Empirical Medicine. Focusing on GPT-3.5 as a case study, the proposed QA framework consistently exhibited a clear advantage over traditional information retrieval approaches and bespoke BERT-family models that were fine-tuned for prioritizing candidate studies (ie, from the BERT to PubMedBERT) across 31 datasets of 4 categories of SRs, underscoring their high potential in facilitating abstract screening. The experiments also showcased the viability of using selection criteria as a query for reference prioritization. The experiments also showcased the viability of the framework using different LLMs. Conclusion: Investigation justified the indispensable value of leveraging selection criteria to improve the performance of automated abstract screening. LLMs demonstrated proficiency in prioritizing candidate studies for abstract screening using the proposed QA framework. Significant performance improvements were obtained by re-ranking answers using the semantic alignment between abstracts and selection criteria. This further highlighted the pertinence of utilizing selection criteria to enhance abstract screening."

      "abstract": "As climate change intensifies, determining a developing region's role in achieving net-zero emissions worldwide is crucial. However, regional efforts, considering historical emissions, remain underexplored. Here, we assess energy system changes, technology adoption, and investments needed for developing regions, including five major- and minor-emitting nations. Our analysis, using an integrated assessment model, shows a large gap in regional efforts toward global net-zero emissions, stemming from the necessary shift of energy systems to low-carbon resources. The use of new technologies, like electric vehicles, hydrogen, and carbon capture, varies by region, with the highest adoption required between 2020 and 2030. Financing this shift needs an average gross domestic product (GDP) investment rise of 0.464% in minor-emitting regions and up to 2.1% in major-emitting regions by 2085. Our results could guide policies and support setting quantifiable targets for developing nations. The findings are key to facilitating strategic technology use and finance mobilization to achieve a carbon-neutral future."

      "abstract": "Community micro-grid energy projects are needed to drive de-carbonisation and increase equity of energy systems among displaced communities. However, micro-grid solutions are often inflexible and lack functionality to respond to displaced community energy needs and ensure the long-term sustainability of interventions. This paper explores the use of fog-computing retrofit architectures deployed on community micro-grid infrastructures to enable flexible demand management to improve service delivery and longevity. A micro-services solution is proposed that decouples components increasing resilience and testability while allowing hybrid edge-cloud deployments. The architecture is outlined and demonstrated for a micro-grid providing energy to two nurseries and a playground in Kigeme refugee camp, Rwanda. To enact the community priorities within the demand management system, modified Genetic Algorithm (GA) methods are outlined and tested for different use-case scenarios. The performance of the modified GA methods are then compared with a pre-existing battery protect controller and an alternative deterministic (space-shared) energy manager model. A modified search space GA method was required for GA to outperform both the existing battery controller and proposed deterministic method in terms of achieving the highest utility function in almost every use-case. The results further showed how simple community priorities can be set and used to enact control on the system in 24h timeframes that are in line with the local decision-making context."

      "abstract": "Historically, SW practice has not always met Black children’s identity needs. In the 70s, it was standard practice to place Black children in white homes. In 2002, legal policy was amended to emphasize children's religion, race, and culture in finding permanent homes. However, in 2014 the legal requirement to consider ethnicity was removed, allowing transracial placements. Many frontline social workers did not agree with this change, arguing that by removing ethnicity, the law devalued the significance of ethnicity to individual children’s identity. Against this backdrop of policy U-turns, and funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, this heritage project explores Black SWs historical navigations around identity – how did they perceive and experience these changes?"

      "abstract": "All children need permanent, caring and secure homes in which they can grow and thrive. There are more than 4500 Muslim-heritage children in the UK who cannot live with their biological families. For some of these children, ethnically and religiously matched homes can lead to more secure futures; however, there is a shortage of Muslim-heritage carers. This article examines the reasons for the lack of Muslim-heritage adopters or foster carers in the UK by combining understandings from Islamic religious texts, contemporary British social work practice, and sociological analysis of children's experiences. The empirical findings presented here are based on semi-structured qualitative interviews (n = 41) with various professionals and carers involved in the care of Muslim-heritage children. Our evidence uncovers specific socio-cultural, political and theological barriers that hinder carers of Muslim backgrounds from coming forward to adopt or foster. By better understanding these barriers, this article provides an evidence base to inform social work policy and practice to enhance recruitment of carers from Muslim backgrounds. The data presented in the paper also contributes to raising awareness within Social Work practice and Muslim communities around the needs of vulnerable children, to improve their life outcomes."

      "abstract": "Despite the increasing prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI) ethics frameworks, the practical application of these frameworks in industrial settings remains limited. This limitation is further augmented in energy systems by the complexity of systems composition and systems operation for energy generation, distribution, and supply. The primary reason for this limitation is the gap between the conceptual notion of ethics principles and the technical performance of AI applications in energy systems. For instance, trust is featured prominently in ethics frameworks but pertains to limited relevance for the robust operation of a smart grid. In this paper, we propose a lifecycle approach for AI ethics that aims to address this gap. The proposed approach consists of four phases: design, development, operation, and evaluation. All four phases are supported by a central AI ethics repository that gathers and integrates the primary and secondary dimensions of ethical practice, including reliability, safety, and trustworthiness, from design through to evaluation. This lifecycle approach is closely aligned with the operational lifecycle of energy systems, from design and production through to use, maintenance, repair, and overhaul, followed by shutdown, recycling, and replacement. Across these lifecycle stages, an energy system engages with numerous human stakeholders, directly with designers, engineers, users, trainers, operators, and maintenance technicians, as well as indirectly with managers, owners, policymakers, and community groups. This lifecycle approach is empirically evaluated in the complex energy system of a multi-campus tertiary education institution where the alignment between ethics and technical performance, as well as the human-centric application of AI, are demonstrated."

Through their narratives, we understand how children in care experience and perceive their identities, as well as their understandings of the care that they receive and desire for their identities. We rely on children’s and young people’s voices and stories. Using an intersectional approach, we worked with Black, Asian and mixed-heritage children and young people (aged 14 to 19) to understand their narratives of identity. We focused firstly on understandings of ethnicity and religion and how these change in relation to other aspects of identity and, crucially, by being in care. Secondly, we examined their experiences of asking and getting help from social workers, foster carers, adopters and other support structures that provide for their identities while in care. By listening to and understanding children and young people’s perspectives around ethnicity, religion and identity, we developed a new framework to inform both theoretical and practical work with children in care. We describe our model as Identities in-Flux, which integrates Kimberlé Crenshaw’s Intersectionality and Meredith McGuires’ Lived Religion theories to generate new frameworks of reference that support best practice when implementing support plans for young people and children. Within this model, we consider the interplay of changing socio-ethnic-religious factors, as well as young people and children’s biological heritage, their being in care and their own agency in determining how they themselves want to be perceived. By broadening discussion from a singular focus on one aspect of identity, such as race or gender, we hope to support inclusive and sensitive practices and policies that reflect and respond to the increasing diversity of children and young people entering care."

      "abstract": "To address the need for improved access to energy and meet the United Nations Clean Energy Challenge (2019), humanitarian agencies require robust, valid, and meaningful data that documents the everyday energy practices of displaced people. Collecting data through sensor monitoring is one way of providing quality energy data that will aid humanitarian actors in designing and delivering sustainable affordable energy solutions. Using the case of the design and deployment of 20 stove use monitors (SUM) in Kigeme refugee camp in Rwanda, this paper discusses the benefits and limitations of collecting data on cookstove usage using wireless sensors in refugee settlements., Central to the discussion is the value of reflexivity or critical reflection to uncover significant knowledge gaps that can apply more generally to the problem of designing and deploying sensor systems for the displaced setting. If sensor monitoring systems are to collect data that aid appropriate energy planning and support technology development in the humanitarian sector, we contend improvements in sensor design and deployment protocols are needed to accommodate the displaced setting's cultural, economic, and political complexity. These improvements include the uptake of sensor monitoring design that embeds ethical, progressive, and inclusive protocols when working in the displaced setting."

      "abstract": "X-ray fluoroscopic images are widely used for image guidance in cardiac electrophysiology (EP) procedures to diagnose or treat cardiac arrhythmias based on catheter ablation. However, the main disadvantage of fluoroscopic imaging is the lack of soft tissue information and harmful radiation. In contrast, ultrasound (US) has the advantages of low-cost, non-radiation, and high contrast in soft tissue. In this paper we propose a framework to extract the catheter from both X-ray and US images in real time for cardiac interventions. The catheter extraction from X-ray images is based on SURF features, local patch analysis and Kalman filtering to acquire a set of sorted key points representing the catheter. At the same time, the transformation between the X-ray and US images can be obtained via 2D/3D rigid registration between a 3D model of the US probe and its projection on X-ray images. By backprojecting the information about the catheter location in the X-ray images to the US images the search space can be drastically reduced. The extraction of the catheter from US is based on 3D SURF feature clusters, graph model building, A* algorithm and B-spline smoothing. Experiments show the overall process can be achieved in 2.72 seconds for one frame and the reprojected error is 1.99 mm on average."

We established end-inspiration, end-expiration and systolic gating with success rates of 100%, 100% and 95.3%, respectively. This technique is useful for retrospective gating of X-ray images and, unlike many previously proposed techniques, does not require specific catheters to be visible and works without any knowledge of catheter geometry."

We answer these intricate questions by proposing a comprehensive visual analysis system to explore the evolution of an urban agglomeration. The method proposes a Voronoi diagram to show the spatial distribution of urban agglomeration and the evolution of urban agglomeration in space, a stacked graph with threads embedded to show urban agglomeration in the time evolution process, and a parallel coordinates diagram to show the pollution situation of urban agglomerations.

H-index not only fails to distinguish researchers with quasi the same h-values, but also lacks the ability to promote researchers’ foci on originality and high quality. Current extensions to h-index by exploiting citation distribution characteristics all exhibit some “pathologically” eccentric behaviors against either real datasets or theoretical distributions. With a motivation of balancing quality and quantity, this paper proposes a new h-type index h*pt by exploiting citation distribution characteristics, which encourages quality by defining reward/penalty factors to excess/long-tail citations, and at the same time balances productivity by scaling citations outside the h-core to the average performance of the long-tail papers. Extensive experiments on both the ACL Anthology Network dataset and several theoretical citation distributions prove that the proposed h*pt achieves reasonably better results than previous h-type extensions."

      "abstract": "Children of Muslim heritage are likely to experience significant delay in finding a fostering or adoptive placement and where a child has complex needs due to health, disability, age, mixed or multiple heritage background or being part of a sibling group, finding permanent placement takes even longer. In some cases, they may never find a permanent home at all. Such delays cause lasting harm for children and according to Selwyn et al, ‘delay in decision making and action has an unacceptable price in terms of the reduction in children’s life chances and the financial costs to local authorities, the emotional and financial burden later placed on adoptive families and future costs to society’ (2006). Policy makers’ response has been to emphasise transracial placements so that the process of finding a permanent home is expedited for these children.\n\nThrough interviews with social workers, foster carers, adoptive parents and prospective adoptive parents, this research presents a research-informed narrative of the complexities in Muslim children’s circumstances and identities, which influence how decisions are made about their lives. By better understanding the journeys of these children through the care system, this research will provide an evidence base for practitioners, policy makers and communities to draw upon, and in doing so will improve outcomes for these children, their families and for society as a whole.\n\nThis research provides strong evidence of the salience of Islam to Muslim children’s identities. When children come into care they experience upheaval, displacement and trauma – in such contexts faith is familiar and enables children to be resilient. If in their new home, children’s faith and ethnic needs are provided, they are happier, are more settled and attach better and sooner to their carers. Foster carers and adopters agree that faith is central to their identities too, that faith motivates them to care for the children they look after and that they may be best placed to meet the needs of children who come from ethnic and religious backgrounds similar to their own. For adopters there was an additional emphasis on the child they adopted ‘looking like them’.\n\nBased on this key finding of the salience of religion to the formation, evolution and preservation of the identities of children in public care, we suggest 7 inter-related recommendations for policy makers, social workers, carers and for the Muslim community to take forward. We do not assign a particular recommendation to a particular group, instead we call for joined-up thinking and collective action from these stakeholders, aimed at prioritising each child’s welfare, security and happiness.\n\nAs a final word we emphasise the good practice that we can evidence in how social workers address the faith needs of Muslim children. The story is by no means only about good practice. Indeed, we have found evidence of blind-spots and lacunae. Nevertheless for a profession that faces regular unfair coverage from the media, it is important to emphasise the strengths of the profession and the conscientious care it provides to the most vulnerable children in our societies. Our intention with this report, is to celebrate and share the good practice and where there are blind-spots to engage critically but also collegially to fill the gaps in provision.\n\nThe seven recommendations we make on the basis of this project are as follows:\n\nRecommendation 1: Include religion in SSDA903 returns and the national DfE database on looked after children\n\nRecommendation 2: Recognise the salience of faith in children’s journeys through the care system and enhance the faith literacy of social work practitioners and policy makers.\n\nRecommendation 3: Develop and disseminate Islamic theological guidance on adoption and fostering that prioritises the children’s needs.\n\nRecommendation 4: Where required adoptive parents need be offered theological advice on the issue of establishing Mahram relations with their adopted children. If they choose to lactate their children they should be offered medical support\n\nRecommendation 5: The agreements between Islamic modesty guidelines and safeguarding policy need to be shared with Muslim foster carers.\n\nRecommendation 6: In line with the recommendation of the Education Select Committee, more outreach, information and recruitment work needs to be undertaken with diverse British Muslim communities to increase the number of Muslim foster carers and adopters.\n\nRecommendation 7: Need to evaluate the impact of the removal of ethnicity from adoption law and guidance in England on practice."

      "abstract": "Thermal discomfort is one of the main triggers for occupants’ interactions with components of the built environment such as adjustments of thermostats and/or opening windows and strongly related to the energy use in buildings. Understanding causes for thermal (dis-)comfort is crucial for design and operation of any type of building. The assessment of human thermal perception through rating scales, for example in post-occupancy studies, has been applied for several decades; however, long-existing assumptions related to these rating scales had been questioned by several researchers. The aim of this study was to gain deeper knowledge on contextual influences on the interpretation of thermal perception scales and their verbal anchors by survey participants. A questionnaire was designed and consequently applied in 21 language versions. These surveys were conducted in 57 cities in 30 countries resulting in a dataset containing responses from 8225 participants. The database offers potential for further analysis in the areas of building design and operation, psycho-physical relationships between human perception and the built environment, and linguistic analyses."

      "abstract": "Over the past decade, several researchers have presented various optimisation algorithms for use in truss design. The no free lunch theorem implies that no optimisation algorithm fits all problems; therefore, the interest is not only in the accuracy and convergence rate of the algorithm but also the tuning effort and population size required for achieving the optimal result. The latter is particularly crucial for computationally intensive or high-dimensional problems. Contrast-based Fruit-fly Optimisation Algorithm (c-FOA) proposed by Kanarachos et al. in 2017 is based on the efficiency of fruit flies in food foraging by olfaction and visual contrast. The proposed Spontaneous Fruit Fly Optimisation (s-FOA) enhances c-FOA and addresses the difficulty in solving nonlinear optimisation algorithms by presenting standard parameters and lean population size for use on all optimisation problems. Six benchmark problems were studied to assess the performance of s-FOA. A comparison of the results obtained from documented literature and other investigated techniques demonstrates the competence and robustness of the algorithm in truss optimisation."

One area, explored in this chapter by the University of Coventry, is the need for wireless sensor networks and communication technology to gather data to inform systematic decision making. This chapter reviews a range of energy technologies and delivery approaches that have been trialled in camps, including discussion of the resulting problems and challenges that have been met. The chapter makes the case for improved energy intervention planning and identifies multi-criteria decision-making approaches that could be utilised in the context of refugee camps for dealing with both evaluation and design problems. The chapter concludes by exploring the possibility of using alternative wireless sensors and monitoring devices to gather data on a range of energy systems to inform decision making and management of shared community resources."

The main focus of the present study is on the effect of Navier’s slip boundary condition on flow behavior. A comprehensive study is presented on the effects of various parameters, such as Navier’s slip condition, mass transpiration (suction/injection), and Darcy number on the axial and transverse velocity profiles of the laminar boundary layer flow through the stretching sheet."

The difference between presentation, explanation and interpretation (for Technical, Investigative or Evaluative purposes) of data is outlined. The authors consider how the term “interpretation” may be used differently in connection with expert witnesses, witnesses giving technical evidence, and by the judiciary, suggesting that this may give rise to unrealistic expectations of a practitioner’s ability to reliably answer questions. Recommendations for core competencies are made for those giving telecommunications evidence to recognise when they are presenting opinion evidence and therefore (potentially inadvertently) acting as expert witnesses."

      "abstract": "Road localisation of autonomous vehicles is reliant on consistent accurate GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) positioning information. Commercial GNSS receivers usually sample at 1 Hz, which is not sufficient to robustly and accurately track a vehicle in certain scenarios, such as driving on the highway, where the vehicle could travel at medium to high speeds, or in safety-critical scenarios. In addition, the GNSS relies on a number of satellites to perform triangulation and may experience signal loss around tall buildings, bridges, tunnels and trees. An approach to overcoming this problem involves integrating the GNSS with a vehicle-mounted Inertial Navigation Sensor (INS) system to provide a continuous and more reliable high rate positioning solution. INSs are however plagued by unbounded exponential error drifts during the double integration of the acceleration to displacement. Several deep learning algorithms have been employed to learn the error drift for a better positioning prediction. We therefore investigate in this chapter the performance of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Input Delay Neural Network (IDNN), Multi-Layer Neural Network (MLNN) and Kalman Filter (KF) for high data rate positioning. We show that Deep Neural Network-based solutions can exhibit better performances for high data rate positioning of vehicles in comparison to commonly used approaches like the Kalman filter."

Unpacking fuel stacking behaviour can shed light onto the speed of transition toward the exclusive use of advanced fuel types. This paper presents findings from surveys that were carried out with 14 non-electrified communities in a rural area of Rio Negro, Amazonas State, Brazil. We identify the fuel choice determinants in these communities using a multinomial logistic regression model and more generally discuss the validity and robustness of such models in the context of statistical validation and evaluation metrics. Specifically for the Amazonas communities considered in this study, the research showed that the fuel choice determinants are the age of household, the number of people at meals each day, the number of meals daily, the community, education of the household head, and the income level of the household. Moreover, given the Brazilian policies related to energy and sustainability, this region is not likely to reach the Sustainable Development Goals proposed by United Nations for 2030."

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: New HIV infections remain higher in women than men in sub-Saharan Africa. Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective HIV prevention measure, currently prioritized for those at highest risk, such as female sex workers (FSWs), for whom it is most cost-effective. However, the greatest number of HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa occurs in women in the general population. As countries consider wider PrEP scale-up, there is a need to weigh the population-level impact, cost, and relative cost-effectiveness to inform priority setting. METHODS: We developed mathematical models of HIV risk to women and derived tools to highlight key considerations for PrEP programming. The models were fitted to South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Kenya, spanning a range of HIV burden in sub-Saharan Africa. The impact, cost, and cost-effectiveness of PrEP scale-up for adolescent girls and young women (AGYW), women 25 to 34 years old, and women 35 to 49 years old were assessed, accounting for differences in population sizes and the low program retention levels reported in demonstration projects. RESULTS: Preexposure prophylaxis could avert substantially more infections a year among women in general population than among FSW. The greatest number of infections could be averted annually among AGYW in South Africa (24-fold that for FSW). In Zimbabwe, the greatest number of infections could be averted among women 25 to 34 years old (8-fold that for FSW); and in Kenya, similarly between AGYW and women 25 to 34 years old (3-fold that for FSW). However, the unit costs of PrEP delivery for AGYW, women 25 to 34 years old, and women 35 to 49 years old would have to reduce considerably (by 70.8%-91.0% across scenarios) for scale-up to these populations to be as cost-effective as for FSW. CONCLUSIONS: Preexposure prophylaxis has the potential to substantially reduce new HIV infections in HIV-endemic countries in sub-Saharan Africa. This will necessitate PrEP being made widely available beyond those at highest individual risk and continued integration into a range of national services and at community level to significantly bring down the costs and improve cost-effectiveness."

Due to the importance of issue and the lack of general statistics on these disorders among the Hospital staff treating the COVID-19 patients, this study aims to systematically review and determine the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression within front-line healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients.Methods In this research work, the systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression approaches are used to approximate the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression within front-line healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients. The keywords of prevalence, anxiety, stress, depression, psychopathy, mental illness, mental disorder, doctor, physician, nurse, hospital staff, 2019-nCoV, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 and Coronaviruses were used for searching the SID, MagIran, IranMedex, IranDoc, ScienceDirect, Embase, Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science (ISI) and Google Scholar databases. The search process was conducted in December 2019 to June 2020. In order to amalgamate and analyze the reported results within the collected studies, the random effects model is used. The heterogeneity of the studies is assessed using the I2 index. Lastly, the data analysis is performed within the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software.Results Of the 29 studies with a total sample size of 22,380, 21 papers have reported the prevalence of depression, 23 have reported the prevalence of anxiety, and 9 studies have reported the prevalence of stress. The prevalence of depression is 24.3% (18% CI 18.2–31.6%), the prevalence of anxiety is 25.8% (95% CI 20.5–31.9%), and the prevalence of stress is 45% (95% CI 24.3–67.5%) among the hospitals’ Hospital staff caring for the COVID-19 patients. According to the results of meta-regression analysis, with increasing the sample size, the prevalence of depression and anxiety decreased, and this was statistically significant (P < 0.05), however, the prevalence of stress increased with increasing the sample size, yet this was not statistically significant (P = 0.829).Conclusion The results of this study clearly demonstrate that the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression within front-line healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients is high. Therefore, the health policy-makers should take measures to control and prevent mental disorders in the Hospital staff."

      "abstract": "Background: In all epidemics, healthcare staff are at the centre of risks and damages caused by pathogens. Today, nurses and physicians are faced with unprecedented work pressures in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in several psychological disorders such as stress, anxiety and sleep disturbances. The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of sleep disturbances in hospital nurses and physicians facing the COVID-19 patients. Method: A systematic review and metanalysis was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA criteria. The PubMed, Scopus, Science direct, Web of science, CINHAL, Medline, and Google Scholar databases were searched with no lower time-limt and until 24 June 2020. The heterogeneity of the studies was measured using I2 test and the publication bias was assessed by the Egger's test at the significance level of 0.05. Results: The I2 test was used to evaluate the heterogeneity of the selected studies, based on the results of I2 test, the prevalence of sleep disturbances in nurses and physicians is I2: 97.4% and I2: 97.3% respectively. After following the systematic review processes, 7 cross-sectional studies were selected for meta-analysis. Six studies with the sample size of 3745 nurses were examined in and the prevalence of sleep disturbances was approximated to be 34.8% (95% CI: 24.8-46.4%). The prevalence of sleep disturbances in physicians was also measured in 5 studies with the sample size of 2123 physicians. According to the results, the prevalence of sleep disturbances in physicians caring for the COVID-19 patients was reported to be 41.6% (95% CI: 27.7-57%). Conclusion: Healthcare workers, as the front line of the fight against COVID-19, are more vulnerable to the harmful effects of this disease than other groups in society. Increasing workplace stress increases sleep disturbances in the medical staff, especially nurses and physicians. In other words, increased stress due to the exposure to COVID-19 increases the prevalence of sleep disturbances in nurses and physicians. Therefore, it is important for health policymakers to provide solutions and interventions to reduce the workplace stress and pressures on medical staff."

Space heating, which is the largest and most expensive part of the energy used in the UK educational buildings is a potential target for improving energy efficiency. However, the role of thermal comfort in students' productivity in academic environments cannot be overlooked. Considering the prevalence of two different climatic conditions in Northern and Southern/Midland regions of the UK, this study investigated thermal comfort in two university campuses in Scotland and England. environmental measurements combined with a simultaneous questionnaire survey were conducted in eight university buildings in Edinburgh and Coventry. The field study was carried out during the academic year of 2017-18 on 3507 students. The results confirmed influence of students' acclimatization, showing a warmer than neutral mean Thermal Sensation Vote (TSV) and cooler thermal preference in Edinburgh than Coventry. The higher acceptable temperature in Coventry (23.5 °C) than Edinburgh (22.1 °C) reinforced the results on the influence of climatic adaptation. Thermal acceptability was examined in a direct (analysing the actual votes on thermal acceptability) and an indirect approach (considering the TSV between −1 and 1 as acceptable). The indirect approach was shown to be a better predictor of the thermal acceptability as this method extends beyond the acceptable range suggested by the direct method. Thermal perceptions of females were shown to be colder than males in university classrooms. However, no statistically significant difference was observed in the thermal comfort of different age groups."

The main aim of this study is thus to closely examine exercise's effect on fatigue of patients with MS worldwide, with particular interest on Iran based on a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: The studies used in this systematic review were selected from the articles published from 1996 to 2019, in national and international databases including SID, Magiran, Iranmedex, Irandoc, Google Scholar, Cochrane, Embase, ScienceDirect, Scopus, PubMed and Web of Science (ISI). These databases were thoroughly searched, and the relevant ones were selected based on some plausible keywords to the aim of this study. Heterogeneity index between studies was determined using Cochran's test and I2. Due to heterogeneity in studies, the random effects model was used to estimate standardized mean difference. Results: From the systematic review, a meta-analysis was performed on 31 articles which were fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The sample including of 714 subjects was selected from the intervention group, and almost the same sample size of 720 individuals were selected in the control group. Based on the results derived from this meta-analysis, the standardized mean difference between the intervention group before and after the intervention was respectively estimated to be 23.8 ± 6.2 and 16.9 ± 3.2, which indicates that the physical exercise reduces fatigue in patients with MS. Conclusion: The results of this study extracted from a detailed meta-analysis reveal and confirm that physical exercise significantly reduces fatigue in patients with MS. As a results, a regular exercise program is strongly recommended to be part of a rehabilitation program for these patients."

Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that a vaccine with at least 55% efficacy was sufficient to contain the outbreak but at higher coverage of 75% (95% Crl 58–88%). However, high-efficacy vaccines would greatly reduce the required coverage, with 100% efficacy vaccine reducing coverage to 45% (95% Crl 35–53%).\n\nConclusions\nThese findings reinforce the crucial need for oral cholera vaccines to control cholera in Zimbabwe, considering that the decay of water reticulation and sewerage infrastructure is unlikely to be effectively addressed in the coming years."

      "abstract": "The role of geospatial disparities in the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic is poorly understood. We developed a spatially-explicit mathematical model to simulate transmission dynamics of COVID-19 disease infection in relation with the uneven distribution of the healthcare capacity in Ohio, U.S. The results showed substantial spatial variation in the spread of the disease, with localized areas showing marked differences in disease attack rates. Higher COVID-19 attack rates experienced in some highly connected and urbanized areas (274 cases per 100,000 people) could substantially impact the critical health care response of these areas regardless of their potentially high healthcare capacity compared to more rural and less connected counterparts (85 cases per 100,000). Accounting for the spatially uneven disease diffusion linked to the geographical distribution of the critical care resources is essential in designing effective prevention and control programmes aimed at reducing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic."

      "abstract": "Sometimes healthcare perspectives in communications technologies require data mining, especially classification as a supervised learning. Support vector machines (SVMs) are considered as efficient supervised learning approaches for classification due to their robustness against several types of model misspecifications and outliers. Kernel-based SVMs are known to be more flexible tools for a wide range of supervised learning tasks and can efficiently handle non-linear relationship between input variables and outputs (or labels). They are more robust with respect to the aforementioned model misspecifications, and also more accurate in the sense that the root-mean-square error computed by fitting the kernel-based SVMs is considerably smaller than the one computed by fitting the standard/linear SVMs. However, the choice of kernel type and particularity kernel’s parameters could have significant impact on the classification accuracy and other supervised learning tasks required in network security, Internet of things, cybersecurity, etc. One of the findings of this study is that larger kernel parameter(s) would encourage SVMs with more localities and vice versa. This chapter provides some results on the effect of the kernel parameter on the kernel-based SVM classification. We thus first examine the effect of these parameters on the classification results using the kernel-based SVM, and then specify the optimal value of these parameters using cross-validation (CV) technique."

The case is made for why civil society organizations (CSOs) must be engaged vigilantly in the COVID-19 response in Africa. Lockdown disruptions and the rerouting of health funds to the pandemic have impeded access to essential sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and social protection services. Compounded by pre-existing inequalities faced by vulnerable populations, the poor SRH outcomes amid COVID-19 call for CSOs to intensify demand for the accountability of governments. CSOs should also continue to persevere in their aim to rapidly close community-health facility gaps and provide safety nets to mitigate the gendered impact of COVID-19."

      "abstract": "The emergence and fast global spread of COVID-19 has presented one of the greatest public health challenges in modern times with no proven cure or vaccine. Africa is still early in this epidemic, therefore the extent of disease severity is not yet clear. We used a mathematical model to fit to the observed cases of COVID-19 in South Africa to estimate the basic reproductive number and critical vaccination coverage to control the disease for different hypothetical vaccine efficacy scenarios. We also estimated the percentage reduction in effective contacts due to the social distancing measures implemented. Early model estimates show that COVID-19 outbreak in South Africa had a basic reproductive number of 2.95 (95% credible interval [CrI] 2.83-3.33). A vaccine with 70% efficacy had the capacity to contain COVID-19 outbreak but at very higher vaccination coverage 94.44% (95% Crl 92.44-99.92%) with a vaccine of 100% efficacy requiring 66.10% (95% Crl 64.72-69.95%) coverage. Social distancing measures put in place have so far reduced the number of social contacts by 80.31% (95% Crl 79.76-80.85%). These findings suggest that a highly efficacious vaccine would have been required to contain COVID-19 in South Africa. Therefore, the current social distancing measures to reduce contacts will remain key in controlling the infection in the absence of vaccines and other therapeutics."

We benefit from the martingale theory and Poisson equations to prove and establish the convergence of the first passage time of reward processes to a zero mean Brownian motion. Necessary conditions to derive the results presented in this article are the existence of variances for sojourn times in each state and second order integrability of reward functions with respect to the distribution of sojourn times. We finally verify the presented methodology through a numerical illustration."

      "abstract": "In this paper, we extensively investigate the way in which κ - μ fading channels can be impacted by shadowing. Following from this, a family of shadowed κ - μ fading models are introduced and classified according to whether the underlying κ - μ fading undergoes single or double shadowing. In total, we discuss three types of single shadowed κ - μ model (denoted Type I to Type III) and three types of double shadowed κ - μ model (denoted Type I to Type III). The taxonomy of the single shadowed Type I - III models is dependent upon whether the fading model assumes that the dominant component, the scattered waves, or both experience shadowing. Although the physical definition of the examined models make no predetermination of the statistics of the shadowing process, for illustrative purposes, two example cases are provided for each type of single shadowed model by assuming that the shadowing is influenced by either a Nakagami- m random variable (RV) or an inverse Nakagami- m RV. It is worth noting that these RVs have been shown to provide an adequate characterization of shadowing in numerous communication scenarios of practical interest. The categorization of the double shadowed Type I - III models is dependent upon whether a) the envelope experiences shadowing of the dominant component, which is preceded (or succeeded) by a secondary round of (multiplicative) shadowing, or b) the dominant and scattered contributions are fluctuated by two independent shadowing processes, or c) the scattered waves of the envelope are subject to shadowing, which is also preceded (or succeeded) by a secondary round of multiplicative shadowing. Similar to the single shadowed models, we provide two example cases for each type of double shadowed model by assuming that the shadowing phenomena are shaped by a Nakagami- m RV, an inverse Nakagami- m RV or their mixture. It is worth highlighting that the double shadowed κ - μ models offer remarkable flexibility as they include the κ - μ , η - μ , and the various types of single shadowed κ - μ distribution as special cases. This property renders them particularly useful for the effective characterization and modeling of the diverse composite fading conditions encountered in communication scenarios in many emerging wireless applications."

More complex, dynamic models account for time-dependent changes but are complicated to understand and produce. Under which conditions are static models adequate? We compare static and dynamic model predictions of whether behavioural disinhibition could undermine the impact of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) provision to female sex workers in South Africa.\nMETHODS: A static model of HIV risk was developed and adapted into a dynamic model. Both models were used to estimate the possible reduction in condom use, following PrEP introduction, without increasing HIV risk. The results were compared over a 20-year time horizon, in two contexts: at epidemic equilibrium and during an increasing epidemic.\nRESULTS: Over time horizons of up to 5 years, the models are consistent. Over longer timeframes, the static model overstates the tolerated reduction in condom use where initial condom use is reasonably high ($\\ge$50%) and/or PrEP effectiveness is low ($\\le$45%), especially during an increasing epidemic.\nCONCLUSIONS: Static models can provide useful deductions to guide policymaking around the introduction of a new HIV intervention over short-medium time horizons of up to 5 years. Over longer timeframes, static models may not sufficiently emphasise situations of programmatic importance, especially where underlying epidemics are still increasing."

However, position errors grow exponentially due to noises in the measurements. Several deep learning techniques have been investigated to mitigate the errors for a better navigation solution [1-10]. However, these studies have involved the use of different datasets not made publicly available. The lack of a robust benchmark dataset has thus hindered the advancement in the research, comparison and adoption of deep learning techniques for vehicle positioning based on inertial navigation. In order to facilitate the benchmarking, fast development and evaluation of positioning algorithms, we therefore present the first of its kind large-scale and information-rich inertial and odometry focused public dataset called IO-VNBD (Inertial Odometry Vehicle Navigation Benchmark Dataset).The vehicle tracking dataset was recorded using a research vehicle equipped with ego-motion sensors on public roads in the United Kingdom, Nigeria, and France. The sensors include a GPS receiver, inertial navigation sensors, wheel-speed sensors amongst other sensors found on the car as well as the inertial navigation sensors and GPS receiver in an android smart phone sampling at 10HZ. A diverse number of scenarios and vehicle dynamics are captured such as traffic, round-abouts, hard-braking etc. on different road types (country roads, motorways etc.) with varying driving patterns. The dataset consists of a total driving time of about 40 hours over 1,300km for the vehicle extracted data and about 58 hours over 4,400 km for the smartphone recorded data. We hope that this dataset will prove valuable in furthering research on the correlation between vehicle dynamics and its displacement as well as other related studies"

      "abstract": "With the advancement of solid-state devices for lighting, illumination is on the verge of being completely restructured. This revolution comes with numerous advantages and viable opportunities that can transform the world of wireless communications for the better. Solid-state LEDs are rapidly replacing the contemporary incandescent and fluorescent lamps. In addition to their high energy efficiency, LEDs are desirable for their low heat generation, long lifespan, and their capability to switch on and off at an extremely high rate. The ability of switching between different levels of luminous intensity at such a rate has enabled the inception of a new communication technology referred to as visible light communication (VLC). With this technology, the LED lamps are additionally being used for data transmission. This paper provides a tutorial and a survey of VLC in terms of the design, development, and evaluation techniques as well as current challenges and their envisioned solutions. The focus of this paper is mainly directed towards an indoor setup. An overview of VLC, theory of illumination, system receivers, system architecture, and ongoing developments are provided. We further provide some baseline simulation results to give a technical background on the performance of VLC systems. Moreover, we provide the potential of incorporating VLC techniques in the current and upcoming technologies such as fifth-generation (5G), beyond fifth-generation (B5G) wireless communication trends including sixth-generation (6G), and intelligent reflective surfaces (IRSs) among others."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is highly effective in preventing HIV and has the potential to significantly impact the HIV epidemic. Given limited resources for HIV prevention, identifying PrEP provision strategies that maximize impact is critical.\nMETHODS: We used a stochastic individual-based network model to evaluate the direct (infections prevented among PrEP users) and indirect (infections prevented among non-PrEP users as a result of PrEP) benefits of PrEP, the person-years of PrEP required to prevent one HIV infection, and the community-level impact of providing PrEP to populations defined by gender and age in western Kenya and South Africa. We examined sensitivity of results to scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) by comparing two scenarios: maintaining current coverage (\"status quo\") and rapid scale-up to meet programmatic targets (\"fast-track\").\nRESULTS: The community-level impact of PrEP was greatest among women aged 15-24 due to high incidence, while PrEP use among men aged 15-24 yielded the highest proportion of indirect infections prevented in the community. These indirect infections prevented continue to increase over time (western Kenya: 0.4-5.5 (status quo); 0.4-4.9 (fast-track); South Africa: 0.5-1.8 (status quo); 0.5-3.0 (fast-track)) relative to direct infections prevented among PrEP users. The number of person-years of PrEP needed to prevent one HIV infection was lower (59 western Kenya and 69 in South Africa in the status quo scenario; 201 western Kenya and 87 in South Africa in the fast-track scenario) when PrEP was provided only to women compared with only to men over time horizons of up to 5 years, as the indirect benefits of providing PrEP to men accrue in later years.\nCONCLUSIONS: Providing PrEP to women aged 15-24 prevents the greatest number of HIV infections per person-year of PrEP, but PrEP provision for young men also provides indirect benefits to women and to the community overall. This finding supports existing policies that prioritize PrEP use for young women, while also illuminating the community-level benefits of PrEP availability for men when resources permit."

      "abstract": "Farm detection using low resolution satellite images is an important part of digital agriculture applications such as crop yield monitoring. However, it has not received enough attention compared to high-resolution images. Although high resolution images are more efficient for detection of land cover components, the analysis of low-resolution images are yet important due to the low-resolution repositories of the past satellite images used for timeseries analysis, free availability and economic concerns. In this paper, semantic segmentation of farm areas is addressed using low resolution satellite images. The segmentation is performed in two stages; First, local patches or Regions of Interest (ROI) that include farm areas are detected. Next, deep semantic segmentation strategies are employed to detect the farm pixels. For patch classification, two previously developed local patch classification strategies are employed; a two-step semi-supervised methodology using hand-crafted features and Support Vector Machine (SVM) modelling and transfer learning using the pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). For the latter, the high-level features learnt from the massive filter banks of deep Visual Geometry Group Network (VGG-16) are utilized. After classifying the image patches that contain farm areas, the DeepLabv3+ model is used for semantic segmentation of farm pixels. Four different pretrained networks, resnet18, resnet50, resnet101 and mobilenetv2, are used to transfer their learnt features for the new farm segmentation problem. The first step results show the superiority of the transfer learning compared to hand-crafted features for classification of patches. The second step results show that the model trained based on resnet50 achieved the highest semantic segmentation accuracy."

      "abstract": "People's subjective response to any thermal environment is commonly investigated by using rating scales describing the degree of thermal sensation, comfort, and acceptability. Subsequent analyses of results collected in this way rely on the assumption that specific distances between verbal anchors placed on the scale exist and that relationships between verbal anchors from different dimensions that are assessed (e.g. thermal sensation and comfort) do not change. Another inherent assumption is that such scales are independent of the context in which they are used (climate zone, season, etc.). Despite their use worldwide, there is indication that contextual differences influence the way the scales are perceived and therefore question the reliability of the scales’ interpretation. To address this issue, a large international collaborative questionnaire study was conducted in 26 countries, using 21 different languages, which led to a dataset of 8225 questionnaires. Results, analysed by means of robust statistical techniques, revealed that only a subset of the responses are in accordance with the mentioned assumptions. Significant differences appeared between groups of participants in their perception of the scales, both in relation to distances of the anchors and relationships between scales. It was also found that respondents’ interpretations of scales changed with contextual factors, such as climate, season, and language. These findings highlight the need to carefully consider context-dependent factors in interpreting and reporting results from thermal comfort studies or post-occupancy evaluations, as well as to revisit the use of rating scales and the analysis methods used in thermal comfort studies to improve their reliability."

While existing studies have mainly utilized joint computation with direct coordination between nodes in different segments, it is worth considering another scenario where an additional node within a layer relays data to another layer. As a consequence, the node can serve as an aggregation point for data capture units prior to transmission to the sink node. However, this new arrangement produces additional transmission paths and can thus cause additional energy spending. This pilot study investigates the joint computation problem aiming at optimizing energy consumption. Relevant components, such as computation and communication, are taken into account and modeled into formal representation. A genetic algorithm-based solution is then used as a tool to optimize parameter setup. According to the experiment results, the metaheuristic algorithm has potential to achieve the optimal system configuration, emphasizing the data length that affects the final energy spending on communications. However, the algorithm cannot always guarantee the optimality as it relies on the random variable used in the process."

To this end, accurate analytic expressions for the effective capacity are derived along with simple tight bound representations. Additionally, simple approximate expressions at the high average signal-to-noise ratio regime are also provided. The effective capacity is then analyzed for different delay constraint, multipath fading and shadowing conditions. The numerical results show that the achievable spectral efficiency lessens as the multipath fading and shadowing parameters decrease (i.e., severe multipath fading and heavy shadowing become prevalent) or the delay constraint increases. The accuracy and tightness of the proposed bounds is demonstrated and approximate representations are also provided to verify their usefulness. Furthermore, our numerical results are validated through a careful comparison with the simulated results."

It assesses the opportunities that DT can offer for smart cities, and covers the requirements for ensuring secure, safe and sustainable smart cities. Further, the book demonstrates that DT and its benefits with regard to:\n\ndata visualisation, real-time data analytics, and learning leading to improved confidence in decision making; reasoning, monitoring and warning to support accurate diagnostics and prognostics; acting using edge control and what-ifanalysis; and connection with back-end business applications hold significant potential for applications in smart cities, by employing a wide range of sensory and data-acquisition systems in various parts of the urban infrastructure.\n\nThe contributing authors reveal how and why DT technologies that are used for monitoring, visualising, diagnosing and predicting in real-time are vital to cities’ sustainability and efficiency. The concepts outlined in the book represents a city together with all of its infrastructure elements, which communicate with each other in a complex manner. Moreover, securing Internet of Things (IoT) which is one of the key enablers of DT’s is discussed in details and from various perspectives.\n\nThe book offers an outstanding reference guide for practitioners and researchers in manufacturing, operations research and communications, who are considering digitising some of their assets and related services. It is also a valuable asset for graduate students and academics who are looking to identify research gaps and develop their own proposals for further research."

The risk of tardive frost damage in vineyards due to changing climate is considered as an important threat to the sustainable production of grapes. Therefore, the cold monitoring strategies is one of the criteria with significant impacts on the yields and prosperity of horticulture and raisin factories. Frost events can be characterized by duration and severity. This paper investigates the risk and impacts of frost phenomenon in the vineyards by modeling the joint distribution of duration and severity factors and analyzing the influential parameter’s dependency structure using capabilities of copula functions. A novel mathematical framework is developed within this study to understand the risk and uncertainties associate with frost events and the impacts on yields of vineyards by analyzing the non-linear dependency structure using copula functions as an efficient tool. The developed model was successfully validated for the case study of vineyard in Malayer city of Iran. The copula model developed in this study was shown to be a robust tool for predicting the return period of the frost events."

Whilst Ireland and the United Kingdom (UK) are geographically close, politics and history have combined to give each region its own experience of faith, culture, and globalised religion. We outline below how the LDS Church is experienced in these locations, the challenges it encounters in conducting missionary work, and the commonalities and divergences in the everyday religious experiences of its UK and Irish membership."

      "abstract": "Many biological and biomedical research areas such as drug design require analyzing the Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) to provide clear insight and understanding of the cellular processes in live cells. Under normality assumption for the genes, GRNs can be constructed by assessing the nonzero elements of the inverse covariance matrix. Nevertheless, such techniques are unable to deal with non-normality, multi-modality and heavy tailedness that are commonly seen in current massive genetic data. To relax this limitative constraint, one can apply copula function which is a multivariate cumulative distribution function with uniform marginal distribution. However, since the dependency structures of different pairs of genes in a multivariate problem are very different, the regular multivariate copula will not allow for the construction of an appropriate model. The solution to this problem is using Pair-Copula Constructions (PCCs) which are decompositions of a multivariate density into a cascade of bivariate copula, and therefore, assign different bivariate copula function for each local term. In fact, in this paper, we have constructed inverse covariance matrix based on the use of PCCs when the normality assumption can be moderately or severely violated for capturing a wide range of distributional features and complex dependency structure. To learn the non-Gaussian model for the considered GRN with non-Gaussian genomic data, we apply modified version of copula-based PC algorithm in which normality assumption of marginal densities is dropped. This paper also considers the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm to determine the existence of a time delay relation between two genes. Breast cancer is one of the most common diseases in the world where GRN analysis of its subtypes is considerably important; Since by revealing the differences in the GRNs of these subtypes, new therapies and drugs can be found. The findings of our research are used to construct GRNs with high performance, for various subtypes of breast cancer rather than simply using previous models."

Although there have been several studies on the factors affecting the reuse of building components, there is no single study that has tried to harmonize the circumstances affecting this intervention. Through a systematic literature review targeting peer-reviewed journal articles, this study intends to identify and stratify factors affecting the reuse of components of the superstructure of a building and eventually delineate correlations between these factors. Factors identified throughout this study are classified into six major categories and 23 sub-categories. Then the inter-dependencies between the barriers are studied by developing the correlation indices between the sub-categories. Results indicate that addressing the economic, social and regulatory barriers should be prioritized. Although the impact of barriers under perception, risk, compliance and market sub-categories are very pronounced, the highest inter-dependency among the sub-categories is found between perception and risk. It suggests that the perception of the stakeholders about building components reuse is affected by the potential risks associated with this intervention."

      "abstract": "The increasing popularity of Internet of Things-enabled Intra-Vehicular Wireless Sensor Networks (IoT-IVWSNs) relying on IEEE 802.15.4 standard has generated a massive amount of wireless data traffic and put a great pressure in the network functionalities. Along this trend, the existing medium-access control (MAC) protocol struggles to keep up with the unprecedented demand of vehicle monitoring sensors simultaneously emitting data, which can lead to packet collisions, severe network congestion and lost of time-critical data, due to the inflexible characteristics of the protocol. In order to mitigate these issues, this work proposes an enhanced MAC scheme that is scalable to account for diverse sensor-traffic quality of services. The hybrid scheme aims to effectively combine two procedures, namely history- and priority-based MAC, to allocate appropriate network resources for smooth transmission flow from multiple sensors. History-based MAC exploits historical contention data to optimize a near-future contention window that aims to minimize packet collision and expedite the average data delivery. Priority-based MAC assigns priority based on the time-criticality of the sensing data, which is subsequently being used to schedules network resources. Numerical results show the desirable performance of the hybrid scheme for IoT-IVWSNs in comparison to the existing MAC and sole history-based or priority-based strategies in the context of packet delivery ratio and transmission delay."

This paper proposes a new hardware approach to SOM implementation, exploiting parallelization, to optimize the system's processing time. Unlike most implementations in the literature, this proposed approach allows the parallelization of the data dimensions instead of the map, ensuring high processing speed regardless of data dimensions. An implementation with field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) is presented and evaluated. Key evaluation metrics are processing time (or throughput) and FPGA area occupancy (or hardware resources)."

We refer to choices which have no effect on the mathematical correctness of the software, but do impact its performance.\n\nIn the past we experimented with one such choice: the variable ordering to use when building a Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD). We used the Python library Scikit-Learn (sklearn) to experiment with different ML models, and developed new techniques for feature generation and hyper-parameter selection.\n\n\nThese techniques could easily be adapted for making decisions other than our immediate application of CAD variable ordering. Hence in this paper we present a software pipeline to use sklearn to pick the variable ordering for an algorithm that acts on a polynomial system. The code described is freely available online."

This has penetrated a wide range of industries; BD as a notion has various types and characteristics, and therefore a variety of analytic techniques would be required. The traditional analysis methods are typically unable to analyse spatial-temporal BD. Interpolation is required to approximate the values between the already existing data points, yet since there exist both location and time dimensions, only a multivariate interpolation would be appropriate. Nevertheless, existing software are unable to perform such complex interpolations. To overcome this challenge, this paper presents a layer by layer interpolation approach for spatial-temporal BD. Developing this layered structure provides the opportunity for working with much smaller linear system of equations. Consequently, this structure increases the accuracy and stability of numerical structure of the considered BD interpolation. To construct this layer by layer interpolation, we have used the good properties of Radial Basis Functions (RBFs). The proposed new approach is applied to numerical examples in spatial-temporal big data and the obtained results confirm the high accuracy and low computational cost. Finally, our approach is applied to explore one of the air pollution indices, i.e. daily PM2.5 concentration, based on different stations in the contiguous United States, and it is evaluated by leave-one-out cross validation."

Clustering is usually treated as an unsupervised machine learning task, but we can formulate a solution to a clustering problem by using a supervised classification algorithm [1]. However, these classification algorithms are highly computationally intensive in nature, so the overall complexity in designing a clustering solution is often very costly from an implementation point of view. The more data we use, the more computational power is required too. Recent advancements in quantum computing show promising advantages in dealing with this kind of computational issues we face while training a complex machine-learning algorithm. In this paper, we do a theoretical investigation on the runtime complexity of algorithms, from classical to randomized, and then to quantum frameworks, when designing a clustering algorithm. The analysis shows significant computational advantages with a quantum framework as compared to the classical and randomized versions of the implementation."

      "abstract": "In October 2018, the Prophet Russell M. Nelson informed members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that the Church teaching curriculum would shift focus away from lessons taught on Sunday. Instead, members were now asked to engage with ‘home-centred, church-supported’ religious instruction using the Church materials ‘Come, Follow Me’. In a religion where Church leaders still defend the idealised family structure of a stay-at-home mother and a father as the provider, the renewed emphasis on the domestic sphere as the site for Church teaching could also reinforce traditional Mormon gender roles. This article draws upon the lived religion of Latter-day Saint women in Sweden, Greece and England to understand how they negotiate gender in their homes. Looking at the implementation of ‘Come, Follow Me’ of sacralising of the home as a gendered practice, there appears to be reinforcing the primacy of the domestic space in the reproduction of religious practices and doctrinal instruction. Simultaneously, in conceptualising a gender role, the guardian of the family, I show the ways that European Latter-day Saint women are providing, protecting and nurturing their families. The domestic space then becomes instrumental in providing space for more nuanced, complex gender constructs that accommodate Mormon beliefs, cultural context and secular notions of gender without destabilising the institutional structure."

In the absence of GNSS signals, information on the speed of the wheels of a vehicle (or other robots alike), recorded from the wheel encoder, can be used to provide continuous positioning information for the vehicle, through the integration of the vehicle's linear velocity to displacement. However, the displacement estimation from the wheel speed measurements are characterised by uncertainties, which could be manifested as wheel slips or/and changes to the tyre size or pressure, from wet and muddy road drives or tyres wearing out. As such, we exploit recent advances in deep learning to propose the Wheel Odometry neural Network (WhONet) to learn the uncertainties in the wheel speed measurements needed for correction and accurate positioning. The performance of the proposed WhONet is first evaluated on several challenging driving scenarios, such as on roundabouts, sharp cornering, hard-brake and wet roads (drifts). WhONet's performance is then further and extensively evaluated on longer-term GNSS outage scenarios of 30 s, 60 s, 120 s and 180 s duration, respectively over a total distance of 493 km. The experimental results obtained show that the proposed method is able to accurately position the vehicle with up to 93% reduction in the positioning error of its original counterpart (physics model) after any 180 s of travel."

Although multiple risk factors for COVID-19 have been identified, using this data to improve clinical care has proven challenging. The main aim of this study is to develop a reliable, multivariable predictive model for COVID-19 in-patient outcomes, thus enabling risk-stratification and earlier clinical decision-making. Methods: Anonymised data consisting of 44 independent predictor variables from 355 adults diagnosed with COVID-19, at a UK hospital, was manually extracted from electronic patient records for retrospective, case–control analysis. Primary outcomes included inpatient mortality, required ventilatory support, and duration of inpatient treatment. Pulmonary embolism sequala was the only secondary outcome. After balancing data, key variables were feature selected for each outcome using random forests. Predictive models were then learned and constructed using Bayesian networks. Results: The proposed probabilistic models were able to predict, using feature selected risk factors, the probability of the mentioned outcomes. Overall, our findings demonstrate reliable, multivariable, quantitative predictive models for four outcomes, which utilise readily available clinical information for COVID-19 adult inpatients. Further research is required to externally validate our models and demonstrate their utility as risk stratification and clinical decision-making tools."

Micro-Doppler radars are an appealing solution considering their non-intrusiveness, deep penetration, and high-distance range. Unsupervised activity recognition using Doppler radar data has not received attention, in spite of its importance in case of unlabelled or poorly labelled activities in real scenarios. This study proposes two unsupervised feature extraction methods for the purpose of human activity monitoring using Doppler-streams. These include a local Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)-based feature extraction method and a local entropy-based feature extraction method. In addition, a novel application of Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) feature extraction is employed for the first time for Doppler radar data. The three feature extraction architectures are compared with the previously used Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) and linear feature extraction based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and 2DPCA. Unsupervised clustering is performed using K-Means and K-Medoids. The results show the superiority of DCT-based method, entropy-based method, and CVAE features compared to CAE, PCA, and 2DPCA, with more than 5%-20% average accuracy. In regards to computation time, the two proposed methods are noticeably much faster than the existing CVAE. Furthermore, for high-dimensional data visualisation, three manifold learning techniques are considered. The methods are compared for the projection of raw data as well as the encoded CVAE features. All three methods show an improved visualisation ability when applied to the encoded CVAE features."

A multivariate stepwise backward elimination method was carried out to explore factors determining understanding of HIV risk after controlling for confounding factors using the most recent ZDHS data (2015–2016).\n\nResults\nThe results from the three surveys showed that, in general apostolic sector had low understanding of HIV and associated risk factors compared to other religious groups. Analysis of the 2015–2016 ZDHS data showed that women belonging to the apostolic sector were less likely to know where to get an HIV test odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval, 0.665 (0.503–0.880) and to know that male circumcision reduces HIV transmission OR 0.863 (0.781–0.955). Women from this group had no knowledge that circumcised men can be infected if they do not use condoms OR 0.633 (0.579–0.693), nor that it is possible for a healthy-looking person to have HIV, OR 0.814 (0.719–0.921). They would not buy vegetables from a vendor with HIV OR 0.817 (0.729–0.915) and were less likely to support that HIV positive children should be allowed to attend school with HIV negative children OR 0.804 (0.680–0.950). Similar results were obtained for men in the apostolic sector. These men also did not agree that women were justified to use condoms if the husband has an Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) OR 0.851 (0.748–0.967).\n\nConclusions\nOur results suggest that apostolic sector lack adequate knowledge of HIV and associated risk factors than other religious groups. Targeting HIV prevention programmes by religious groups could be an efficient approach for controlling HIV in Zimbabwe."

      "abstract": "Our computers today, from sophisticated servers to small smartphones, operate based on the same computing model, which requires running a sequence of discrete instructions, specified as an algorithm. This sequential computing paradigm has not yet led to a fast algorithm for an NP-complete problem despite numerous attempts over the past half a century. Unfortunately, even after the introduction of quantum mechanics to the world of computing, we still followed a similar sequential paradigm, which has not yet helped us obtain such an algorithm either. Here a completely different model of computing is proposed to replace the sequential paradigm of algorithms with inherent parallelism of physical processes. Using the proposed model, instead of writing algorithms to solve NP-complete problems, we construct physical systems whose equilibrium states correspond to the desired solutions and let them evolve to search for the solutions. The main requirements of the model are identified and quantum circuits are proposed for its potential implementation."

There are approximately 4500 children of Muslim heritage in the care system in England and Wales, and this number is increasing. Using case studies that emerged from qualitative fieldwork, this article examines the role and impact of religion on children’s journeys through the care system, particularly in foster care. This article concludes that irrespective of the level of engagement Muslim heritage children in the care system have with their religious heritage, Islam has an enduring impact on how they perceive their identities. As a result, there is a pressing need for social workers and foster carers who care for these children to gain greater insights into Islam and Muslim culture. Such insights and understandings will help children settle faster and form stronger bonds of attachment with their foster carers, and in the long term, this will enhance life outcomes for these children."

We aimed to determine the contribution of potential factors and to identify areas at higher risk of anemia for women in reproductive age in SSA. Our study population comprised 27 nationally representative samples of women of reproductive age (15–49) who were enrolled in the Demographic and Health Surveys and conducted between 2010 and 2019 in SSA. Overall, we found a positive association between being anemic and the ecological exposure to malaria incidence [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02–1.02], and HIV prevalence (AOR = 1.01, CI 1.01–1.02). Women currently pregnant or under deworming medication for the last birth had 31% (AOR = 1.31, CI 1.24–1.39) and 5% (AOR = 1.05, CI 1.01–1.10) higher odds of having anemia, respectively. Similarly, women age 25–34 years old with low education, low income and living in urban settings had higher odds of having anemia. In addition, underweight women had 23% higher odds of suffering anemia (AOR = 1.23, CI 1.15–1.31). Females with low levels of education and wealth index were consistently associated with anemia across SSA. Spatial distribution shows increased risk of anemia in Central and Western Africa. Knowledge about the contribution of known major drivers and the spatial distribution of anemia risk can mitigate operational constraints and help to design geographically targeted intervention programs in SSA."

Specifically, an evidence base was built around two community co-conceived standalone photovoltaic-battery systems, which were deployed in two refugee camps in Rwanda. We found that for both installations (a micro-grid and a community hall electrification system) energy consumption levels were low, showing that sizeable energy consumption gaps can still develop when co-conceived interventions are deployed. The consumption gap led to low performance ratios (33% and 25% respectively for the micro-grid and community hall system). To guide further work and improve the sustainability of community interventions, we draw a number of design principles for future energy interventions in similar contexts. To deliver sustainable energy transitions for refugees, there needs to be a move towards co-creating community interventions that promote self-governance to position communities as users, maintainers and suppliers of energy services, throughout an intervention's lifetime."

Various services using semantic data such as public data integration of smart cities, semantic search, and linked open data are emerging, and services that open and freely use semantic data are also increasing. By using semantic data, it is possible to create a variety of services regardless of platform and resource characteristics. However, despite the many advantages of semantic data, it is not easy to use because it requires a high understanding of semantics such as SPARQL. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a semantic framework for users of\nsemantic data so that new services can be created without a high understanding of semantics. The semantics framework includes a template-based annotator that supports automatically generating semantic data based on user input and a semantic REST API that allows you to utilize semantic data without understanding SPARQL."

In this paper, we consider potential simultaneous fault on sensors and actuators of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. The faults are estimated using a Jump-Markov Regularized Particle Filter. The jump Markov decision process is used within a regularized particle filter structure to drive a small subset of particles to test the likelihood of the alternate hypothesis to the current fault mode. A prior distribution of the fault is updated using innovations based on predicted control and measurements. Fault scenarios were focused on cases when the impacts of the actuator and sensor faults are similar. Monte Carlo simulations illustrate the ability of the approach to discriminate between the two types of faults and to accurately and rapidly estimate them. The states are also accurately estimated."

Critically, the unlicensed sender uses energy harvested from licensed signals, enhancing the overall energy efficiency and maintaining the integrity of licensed communications. To secure messages broadcast by the unlicensed sender against the wire-tapper, full-duplex destinations – unlicensed recipient and licensed receiver – jam the eavesdropper at the same time they receive signals from the unlicensed sender. To this effect, we derive closed-form formulas for the secrecy outage\nprobability, which then quantify the security performance of both unlicensed and licensed communications for EHOCNs with jamming-assisted full-duplex destinations, namely EHOCNwFD. In addition, optimum operating parameters are established, which can serve as essential design guidelines of such systems."

To assess their safe design and robust decision making in response to all possible scenarios, new methods that use a scenario-based testing approach are needed, as testing on public roads in normal traffic would require driving millions of kilometres. We make use of the scenario-based testing approach and propose a method to model simulated scenarios using Gaussian Process based models to predict untested scenario outcomes. This enables us to efficiently determine the performance boundary, where the safe and unsafe scenarios can be evidently distinguished from each other. We present an iterative method that optimises the parameter space of a logical scenario towards the most critical scenarios on this performance boundary. Additionally, we conduct a novel probabilistic sensitivity analysis by efficiently computing several variance-based sensitivity indices using the Gaussian Process models and evaluate the relative importance of the scenario input parameters on the scenario outcome. We critically evaluate and investigate the usefulness of the proposed Gaussian Process based approach as a very efficient surrogate model, which can model the logical scenarios effectively in the presence of uncertainty. The proposed approach is applied on an exemplary logical scenario and shows viability in finding concrete critical scenarios. The reported results, derived from the proposed approach, could pave the way to more efficient testing of automated vehicles and instruct further physical tests on the determined critical scenarios."

      "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is one of the most significant advances in cardiac imaging. Although TEE provides real-time 3D visualization of heart tissues and blood vessels and has no ionizing radiation, X-ray fluoroscopy still dominates in guidance of cardiac interventions due to TEE having a limited field of view and poor visualization of surgical instruments. Therefore, fusing 3D echo with live X-ray images can provide a better guidance solution. This paper proposes a novel framework for image fusion by detecting the pose of the TEE probe in X-ray images in real-time. The framework does not require any manual initialization. Instead it uses a cascade classifier to compute the position and in-plane rotation angle of the TEE probe. The remaining degrees of freedom are determined by fast marching against a template library. The proposed framework is validated on phantoms and patient data. The target registration error for the phantom was 2.1 mm. In addition, 10 patient datasets, seven of which were acquired from cardiac electrophysiology procedures and three from trans-catheter aortic valve implantation procedures, were used to test the clinical feasibility as well as accuracy. A mean registration error of 2.6 mm was achieved, which is well within typical clinical requirements."

      "abstract": "The construction sector is the largest consumer of raw materials and accounts for 25%–40% of the total CO2 emissions globally. Besides, construction activities produce the highest amount of waste among all other sectors. According to the waste hierarchies, reuse is preferred to recycling; however, most of the recovery of construction and demolition wastes happens in the form of recycling and not reuse. Part of the recent efforts to promote the reuse rates includes estimating the reusability of the load-bearing building components to assist the stakeholders in making sound judgements of the reuse potentials at the end-of-life of a building and alleviate the uncertainties and perceived risks. This study aims to develop a probabilistic model using advanced supervised machine learning techniques (including random forest, K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm, Gaussian process, and support vector machine) to predict the reuse potential of structural elements at the end-of-life of a building. For this purpose, using an online questionnaire, this paper seeks the experts’ opinions with actual reuse experience in the building sector to assess the identified barriers by the authors in an earlier study. Furthermore, the results of the survey are used to develop an easy-to-understand learner for assessing the technical reusability of the structural elements at the end-of-life of a building. The results indicate that the most significant factors affecting the reuse of building structural components are design-related including, matching the design of the new building with the strength of the recovered element."

Multiple risk factors for COVID-19 have been identified including various demographics, co-morbidities, biochemical parameters, and physical assessment findings. However, using this vast data to improve clinical care has proven challenging. Aims to develop a reliable, multivariable predictive model for COVID-19 in-patient outcomes, to aid risk-stratification and earlier clinical decision-making. Methods Anonymized data regarding 44 independent predictor variables of 355 adults diagnosed with COVID-19, at a UK hospital, was manually extracted from electronic patient records for retrospective, case-controlled analysis. Primary outcomes included inpatient mortality, level of ventilatory support and oxygen therapy required, and duration of inpatient treatment. Secondary pulmonary embolism was the only secondary outcome. After balancing data, key variables were feature selected for each outcome using random forests. Predictive models were created using Bayesian Networks, and cross-validated. Results Our multivariable models were able to predict, using feature selected risk factors, the probability of inpatient mortality (F1 score 83.7%, PPV 82%, NPV 67.9%); level of ventilatory support required (F1 score varies from 55.8% “High-flow Oxygen level” to 71.5% “ITU-Admission level”); duration of inpatient treatment (varies from 46.7% for “≥ 2 days but < 3 days” to 69.8% “≤ 1 day”); and risk of pulmonary embolism sequelae (F1 score 85.8%, PPV of 83.7%, and NPV of 80.9%). Conclusion Overall, our findings demonstrate reliable, multivariable predictive models for 4 outcomes, that utilize readily available clinical information for COVID-19 adult inpatients. Further research is required to externally validate our models and demonstrate their utility as clinical decision-making tools."

      "abstract": "Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have the potential to solve many traffic problems, such as accidents, congestion and pollution. However, there are still challenges to overcome, for instance, AVs need to accurately perceive their environment to safely navigate in busy urban scenarios. The aim of this paper is to review recent articles on computer vision techniques that can be used to build an AV perception system. AV perception systems need to accurately detect non-static objects and predict their behaviour, as well as to detect static objects and recognise the information they are providing. This paper, in particular, focuses on the computer vision techniques used to detect pedestrians and vehicles. There have been many papers and reviews on pedestrians and vehicles detection so far. However, most of the past papers only reviewed pedestrian or vehicle detection separately. This review aims to present an overview of the AV systems in general, and then review and investigate several detection computer vision techniques for pedestrians and vehicles. The review concludes that both traditional and Deep Learning (DL) techniques have been used for pedestrian and vehicle detection; however, DL techniques have shown the best results. Although good detection results have been achieved for pedestrians and vehicles, the current algorithms still struggle to detect small, occluded, and truncated objects. In addition, there is limited research on how to improve detection performance in difficult light and weather conditions. Most of the algorithms have been tested on well-recognised datasets such as Caltech and KITTI; however, these datasets have their own limitations. Therefore, this paper recommends that future works should be implemented on more new challenging datasets, such as PIE and BDD100K."

As research has typically focused on optimising the digester and its associated parameters to maximise the biogas yield; this research examines how different objectives can influence how one might want to control the system. The system is initially modelled and validated with measured data and an optimisation algorithm is then applied to control the feedstock flow rate. The results show that the performance of first order AD models, in predicting the biogas yield, only differs from measured data by 9% and that by controlling the feeding rate, the amount of flared biogas and unmet cooking demand can be reduced by 100% and approximately 87%, respectively when they are the only objective functions considered. If the energy cost is also added an objective function, then more precise control of feeding rate is needed to ensure that all three conflicting objectives are equally minimised. This result highlights the importance of using the correct feeding rate in the system and considering the overall system during optimisation as producing more biogas might not result in the most cost-effectivesystem."

Despite these advantages, APSoCs are sensitive to radiation like any other electronic device. Processors embedded in APSoCs, therefore, have to be adequately hardened against ionizing-radiation to make them a viable choice of design for harsh environments. This paper proposes a novel lockstep-based approach to harden the dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 processor in the Xilinx Zynq-7000 APSoC against radiation-induced soft errors by coupling it with a MicroBlaze TMR subsystem in the programmable logic (PL) layer of the Zynq. The proposed technique uses the concepts of checkpointing along with roll-back and roll-forward mechanisms at the software level, i.e. software redundancy, as well as processor replication and checker circuits at the hardware level (i.e. hardware redundancy). Results of fault injection experiments show that the proposed approach achieves high levels of protection against soft errors by mitigating around 98% of bit-flips injected into the register files of both ARM cores while keeping timing performance overhead as low as 25% if block and application sizes are adjusted appropriately. Furthermore, the incorporation of the roll-forward recovery operation in addition to the roll-back operation improves the Mean Workload between Failures (MWBF) of the system by up to ≈19% depending on the nature of the running application, since the application can proceed faster, in a scenario where a fault occurs, when treated with the roll-forward operation rather than roll-back operation. Thus, relatively more data can be processed before the next error occurs in the system."

      "abstract": "The human nervous system is one of the most complicated systems in nature. Complex nonlinear behaviours have been shown from the single neuron level to the system level. For decades, linear connectivity analysis methods, such as correlation, coherence and Granger causality, have been extensively used to assess the neural connectivities and input–output interconnections in neural systems. Recent studies indicate that these linear methods can only capture a certain amount of neural activities and functional relationships, and therefore cannot describe neural behaviours in a precise or complete way. In this review, we highlight recent advances in nonlinear system identification of neural systems, corresponding time and frequency domain analysis, and novel neural connectivity measures based on nonlinear system identification techniques. We argue that nonlinear modelling and analysis are necessary to study neuronal processing and signal transfer in neural systems quantitatively. These approaches can hopefully provide new insights to advance our understanding of neurophysiological mechanisms underlying neural functions. These nonlinear approaches also have the potential to produce sensitive biomarkers to facilitate the development of precision diagnostic tools for evaluating neurological disorders and the effects of targeted intervention."

The faulty measurement is on the pitch angle.\nA jump Markov regularized particle filter is proposed for fault and state estimation of the nonlinear aircraft dynamics, with a Markovian jump strategy to manage the probabilistic transitions between the fault free and faulty modes. The jump strategy uses a small number of sentinel particles to continue testing the alternate hypothesis under both fault free and faulty modes. The proposed filter is shown to outperform the regularized particle filter for this application in terms of fault estimation accuracy and convergence time for scenarios involving both abrupt and incipient faults, without prior knowledge of the fault models. The state estimation is also more accurate and robust to faults using the proposed approach. The root-mean-square error for the altitude is reduced by 77% using the jump Markov regularized particle filter under a pitch sensor fault amplitude of up to 10 degrees. Performance enhancement compared to the regularized particle filter was found to be more pronounced when fault amplitudes increase."

      "abstract": "Many physical, biological and neural systems behave as coupled oscillators, with characteristic phase coupling across different frequencies. Methods such as $n:m$ phase locking value and bi-phase locking value have previously been proposed to quantify phase coupling between two resonant frequencies (e.g. f, 2f/3) and across three frequencies (e.g. f_1, f_2, f_1+f_2), respectively. However, the existing phase coupling metrics have their limitations and limited applications. They cannot be used to detect or quantify phase coupling across multiple frequencies (e.g. f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4, f_1+f_2+f_3-f_4), or coupling that involves non-integer multiples of the frequencies (e.g. f_1, f_2, 2f_1/3+f_2/3). To address the gap, this paper proposes a generalized approach, named multi-phase locking value (M-PLV), for the quantification of various types of instantaneous multi-frequency phase coupling. Different from most instantaneous phase coupling metrics that measure the simultaneous phase coupling, the proposed M-PLV method also allows the detection of delayed phase coupling and the associated time lag between coupled oscillators. The M-PLV has been tested on cases where synthetic coupled signals are generated using white Gaussian signals, and a system comprised of multiple coupled Rossler oscillators. Results indicate that the M-PLV can provide a reliable estimation of the time window and frequency combination where the phase coupling is significant, as well as a precise determination of time lag in the case of delayed coupling. This method has the potential to become a powerful new tool for exploring phase coupling in complex nonlinear dynamic systems."

However, many of them have their limitations, such as poor accuracy for dockings with highly flexible ligands and low docking efficiency. In this paper, a multi-swarm optimization algorithm integrated with Autodock environment is proposed to design a high-performance and high-efficiency docking program, namely, MSLDOCK. The search algorithm is a combination of the random drift particle swarm optimization with a novel multi-swarm strategy and the Solis and Wets local search method with a modified implementation. Due to the algorithm's structure, MSLDOCK also has a multithread mode. The experimental results reveal that MSLDOCK outperforms other two Autodock-based approaches in many aspects, such as self-docking, cross-docking, and virtual screening accuracies as well as docking efficiency. Moreover, compared with three non-Autodock-based docking programs, MSLDOCK can be a reliable choice for self-docking and virtual screening, especially for dealing with highly flexible ligand docking problems. The source code of MSLDOCK can be downloaded for free from https://github.com/lcmeteor/MSLDOCK."

      "abstract": "Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) enables female sex workers (FSWs) to protect themselves from HIV without relying on clients using condoms. Yet, because PrEP reduces HIV risk, financial incentives to not use condoms may lead to risk compensation: reductions in condom use and/or increases in commercial sex, and may reduce the price of unprotected sex. In this analysis, we integrate market forces into a dynamic HIV transmission model to assess how risk compensation could change the impact of PrEP among FSWs and clients. We parameterise how sexual behavior may change with PrEP use among FSWs using stated preference data combined with economic theory. Our projections suggest the impact of PrEP is sensitive to risk compensatory behaviors driven by changes in the economics of sex work. Condom substitution could reduce the impact of PrEP on HIV incidence by 55%, while increases in the frequency of commercial sex to counter decreases in the price charged for unprotected sex among PrEP users could entirely mitigate the impact of PrEP. Accounting for competition between PrEP users and nonusers exacerbates this further. Alternative scenarios where increases in unprotected sex among PrEP users are balanced by decreases in non-PrEP users have the opposite effect, resulting in PrEP having much greater impact. Intervention studies need to determine how HIV prevention products may change the economics of sex work and provision of unprotected sex to enable a better understanding of their impact."

      "abstract": "The importance of an optimal solution for disaster evacuation has recently raised attention from researchers across multiple disciplines. This is not only a serious, but also a challenging task due to the complexities of the evacuees’ behaviors, route planning, and demanding coordination services. Although existing studies have addressed these challenges to some extent, mass evacuation in natural disasters tends to be difficult to predict and manage due to the limitation of the underlying models to capture realistic situations. It is therefore desirable to have on-demand mechanisms of locally-driven computing and data exchange services in order to enable near real-time capture of the disaster area during the evacuation. For this purpose, this paper comprehensively surveys recent advances in information and communication technology-enabled disaster evacuations, with the focus on fog computation and communication services to support a massive evacuation process. A numerous variety of tools and techniques are encapsulated within a coordinated on-demand strategy of an evacuation platform, which is aimed to provide a situational awareness and response. Herein fog services appear to be one of the viable options for responsive mass evacuation because they enable low latency data processing and dissemination. They can additionally provide data analytics support for autonomous learning for both the short-term guidance supports and long-term usages. This work extends the existing data-oriented framework by outlining comprehensive functionalities and providing seamless integration. We review the principles, challenges, and future direction of the state-of-the-art strategies proposed to sit within each functionality. Taken together, this survey highlights the importance of adaptive coordination and reconfiguration within the fog services to facilitate responsive mass evacuations as well as open up new research challenges associated with analytics-embedding network and computation, which is critical for any disaster recovery activities."

However, they are plagued by noises, which grow exponentially over time during the triple integration computation, leading to a poor navigation solution. We explore the wheel encoder as an alternative to the accelerometer of the INS for positional tracking, and for the first time investigate the capability of deep learning using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to learn the uncertainty inherent in the wheel speed measurements. These uncertainties could be manifested as changes in the tyre size or pressure, or wheel slips as a result of worn out tyres or wet/muddy road drive. The proposed solution has less integration steps in its computation, therefore providing the potential for a more accurate positioning estimation. Through a performance evaluation on several challenging scenarios for vehicular driving, such as hard braking, quick changes in vehicular acceleration, and wet/muddy road driving, we show that the wheel speed-based positioning approach is able to achieve up to 81.46 % improvement compared to the INS accelerometer approach."

The INS can be used to continuously position autonomous vehicles during GNSS signal losses around urban canyons, bridges, tunnels and trees, however, it suffers from unbounded exponential error drifts cascaded over time during the multiple integrations of the accelerometer and gyroscope measurements to position. More so, the error drift is characterised by a pattern dependent on time. This paper proposes several efficient neural network-based solutions to estimate the error drifts using Recurrent Neural Networks, such as the Input Delay Neural Network (IDNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network (vRNN), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). In contrast to previous papers published in literature, which focused on travel routes that do not take complex driving scenarios into consideration, this paper investigates the performance of the proposed methods on challenging scenarios, such as hard brake, roundabouts, sharp cornering, successive left and right turns and quick changes in vehicular acceleration across numerous test sequences. The results obtained show that the Neural Network-based approaches are able to provide up to 89.55% improvement on the INS displacement estimation and 93.35% on the INS orientation rate estimation."

However, position errors grow exponentially over time due to noises in the sensor measurements. The lack of a public and robust benchmark dataset has however hindered the advancement in the research, comparison and adoption of recent machine learning techniques such as deep learning techniques to learn the error in the INS for a more accurate positioning of the vehicle. In order to facilitate the benchmarking, fast development and evaluation of positioning algorithms, we therefore present the first of its kind large-scale and information-rich inertial and odometry focused public dataset called IO-VNBD (Inertial Odometry Vehicle Navigation Benchmark Dataset). The vehicle tracking dataset was recorded using a research vehicle equipped with ego-motion sensors on public roads in the United Kingdom, Nigeria, and France. The sensors include a GPS receiver, inertial navigation sensors, wheel-speed sensors amongst other sensors found in the car, as well as the inertial navigation sensors and GPS receiver in an Android smart phone sampling at 10 Hz. A diverse number of driving scenarios were captured such as traffic congestion, round-abouts, hard-braking, etc. on different road types (e.g. country roads, motorways, etc.) and with varying driving patterns. The dataset consists of a total driving time of about 40 h over 1,300 km for the vehicle extracted data and about 58 h over 4,400 km for the smartphone recorded data. We hope that this dataset will prove valuable in furthering research on the correlation between vehicle dynamics and dependable positioning estimation based on vehicle ego-motion sensors, as well as other related studies."

While existing literature focused on ensuring cost-effective lighting, an equally important requirement, namely the visual comfort of motorists, is almost disregarded. This article proposes a novel Internet of Things-enabled system that can be intelligently controlled according to the traffic demand. Cooperative relay-network architecture is the central element that leverages upon placement of cyber-enabled lampposts to allow for sensing-exchanging highway traffic information. Data accumulation is exploited to automate adaptive switching on/off the lighting and provide backtracking detection of faulty lampposts. From the service provider's perspective, we envision to deploy low-cost highly durable sensing and network components to significantly cut down the operating cost. From the road user's perspective, the relay-network is envisaged to provide seamless driving experience where sufficient lighting is always perceived along the road. A critical analysis quantitatively evaluates the seamless driving experience considering car arrival rate, outage probability, and device malfunction probability. A road occupancy-based cost estimation analysis demonstrates the effective cost reduction of the proposal compared to existing systems. Furthermore, the performance of chosen communication modules under different setups is assessed through simulation, suggesting appropriate protocol for different highway traffic conditions."

OBJECTIVE: This publication investigates the impact of fragrances with “warm” and “cold” associated meanings on thermal and overall comfort perception. METHODS: Human subject trials (n = 47) were performed in different temperature-controlled environments following a 3×3 within-subject design considering ambient fragrance (“neutral scent”, “peppermint”, “orange & cinnamon”) and ambient light as variables. RESULTS: Olfactory comfort is shown to have the larger effect on overall comfort perception, comparable in weight to the one of thermal comfort. The impact observed on thermal sensation was in line with the meanings associated the fragrances, whereas it was positive on thermal comfort appreciation regardless of the type of fragrance diffused. CONCLUSIONS: These initial results suggest that olfactory stimulations have the potential to positively impact thermal and overall comfort. The appreciation of the fragrance appears to have a major impact on these interactions and should be deeply considered in future research and features development."

The main bottleneck is the unavailability of sufficiently large medical datasets required for the good performance of deep learning models. This paper proposes a new framework consisting of one variational autoencoder (VAE), two generative adversarial networks, and one auxiliary classifier to artificially generate realistic-looking skin lesion images and improve classification performance. We first train the encoder-decoder network to obtain the latent noise vector with the image manifold’s information and let the generative adversarial network sample the input from this informative noise vector in order to generate the skin lesion images. The use of informative noise allows the GAN to avoid mode collapse and creates faster convergence. To improve the diversity in the generated images, we use another GAN with an auxiliary classifier, which samples the noise vector from a heavy-tailed student t-distribution instead of a random noise Gaussian distribution. The proposed framework was named TED-GAN, with T from the t-distribution and ED from the encoder-decoder network which is part of the solution. The proposed framework could be used in a broad range of areas in medical imaging. We used it here to generate skin lesion images and have obtained an improved classification performance on the skin lesion classification task, rising from 66% average accuracy to 92.5%. The results show that TED-GAN has a better impact on the classification task because of its diverse range of generated images due to the use of a heavy-tailed t-distribution."

      "abstract": "This paper presents a novel diagnostic framework for distributed power systems that is based on using generative adversarial networks for generating artificial knockoffs in the power grid. The proposed framework makes use of the raw data measurements including voltage, frequency, and phase-angle that are collected from each bus in the cyber-physical power systems. The collected measurements are firstly fed into a feature selection module, where multiple state-of-the-art techniques have been used to extract the most informative features from the initial set of available features. The selected features are inputs to a knockoff generation module, where the generative adversarial networks are employed to generate the corresponding knockoffs of the selected features. The generated knockoffs are then fed into a classification module, in which two different classification models are used for the sake of fault diagnosis. Multiple experiments have been designed to investigate the effect of noise, fault resistance value, and sampling rate on the performance of the proposed framework. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through a comprehensive study on the IEEE 118-bus system."

      "abstract": "The safety of vulnerable road users is of paramount importance as transport moves towards fully automated driving. The richness of real-world data required for testing autonomous vehicles is limited and furthermore, available data do not present a fair representation of different scenarios and rare events. Before deploying autonomous vehicles publicly, their abilities must reach a safety threshold, not least with regards to vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians. In this paper, we present a novel Generative Adversarial Networks named the Ped-Cross GAN. Ped-Cross GAN is able to generate crossing sequences of pedestrians in the form of human pose sequences. The Ped-Cross GAN is trained with the Pedestrian Scenario dataset. The novel Pedestrian Scenario dataset, derived from existing datasets, enables training on richer pedestrian scenarios. We demonstrate an example of its use through training and testing the Ped-Cross GAN. The results show that the Ped-Cross GAN is able to generate new crossing scenarios that are of the same distribution from those contained in the Pedestrian Scenario dataset. Having a method with these capabilities is important for the future of transport, as it will allow for the adequate testing of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles on how they correctly perceive the intention of pedestrians crossing the street, ultimately leading to fewer pedestrian casualties on our roads."

      "abstract": "In response to the increasing number of displaced people, the humanitarian sector is exploring innovation as a framework to improve the delivery of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Traditionally, the focus on camp settings and short term solutions have resulted in a humanitarian response that is slow to adapt to the rapidity of technological innovation (Betts and Bloom, 2014). For example, 87.8% of African’s in Sub-Saharan Africa have a mobile phone (World Bank, 2019), yet 80% of displaced people living in camps in this same region still cook over open fires which are linked to long term health and environmental effects (Grafham and Lahn, 2018).\n\nAs a result of the lessons learned from the Humanitarian Engineering and Energy for Displacement (HEED) project around the different perceptions of innovation between key energy stakeholders, this paper looks to engage with questions around ensuring innovation in the humanitarian sector, and more specifically humanitarian energy, is responsible. How can we define responsible? Is responsible innovation a theoretical nicety or can it ensure a just energy transition as outlined by the SDGs? What does responsible innovation look like in reality? Building to our underlying research question: what is the state-of-the-art in responsible innovation for humanitarian energy and how is it implemented at project level?"

In this study, we investigate the use of a six-element distributed antenna system (DAS), operating at 5.8 GHz and mounted on the exterior (i.e., roof and wing mirrors) of an automobile, to enhance signal reliability for pedestrian-to-vehicle (P2V) communications. Due to its low complexity and ease of implementation, we consider the use of a switch-and-examine combining with post-examining selection (SECps) scheme to combine the signal received by the DAS. During our experiments, a pedestrian wearing a wireless device on their chest either stood stationary or walked by the side of a road. It was found that the overall signal reliability depends on not only the number, but also different groupings of the antennas which are selected. The goodness-of-fit results have shown that the temporal behavior of the diversity gain was adequately described by the Gaussian distribution. Building upon this, we also provide some useful insights into the antenna selection through the comparison of three different antenna selection mechanisms, namely per-sample random antenna selection, one-shot antenna selection and per-sample optimal antenna selection."

The DNA strands are modeled by random walks on the three-dimensional cubic lattice with different interactions between two chains of the same type and two chains of different types. This model may be thought of as a classical analog of the quantum three-body problem. In the quantum situation, it is known that three identical quantum particles will form a triplet with an infinite tower of bound states at the point where any pair of particles would have zero binding energy. The phase diagram is mapped out, and the different phase transitions are examined using finite-size scaling. We look particularly at the scaling of the DNA model at the equivalent Efimov point for chains up to 10 000 steps in length. We find clear evidence of several bound states in the finite-size scaling. We compare these states with the expected Efimov behavior."

Current activity recognition techniques are using convolutional neural network (CNN) models with computationally complex classifiers, creating hurdles in obtaining quick responses for abnormal activities. To address these challenges in real-time surveillance, this paper proposes a lightweight deep learning-assisted framework for activity recognition. First, we detect a human in the surveillance stream using an effective CNN model, which is trained on two surveillance datasets. The detected individual is tracked throughout the video stream via an ultra-fast object tracker called the ‘minimum output sum of squared error’ (MOSSE). Next, for each tracked individual, pyramidal convolutional features are extracted from two consecutive frames using the efficient LiteFlowNet CNN. Finally, a novel deep skip connection gated recurrent unit (DS-GRU) is trained to learn the temporal changes in the sequence of frames for activity recognition. Experiments are conducted over five benchmark activity recognition datasets, and the results indicate the efficiency of the proposed technique for real-time surveillance applications compared to the state-of-the-art."

      "abstract": "The appraisal of appropriate levels of investment for devising flooding mitigation and to support recovery interventions is a complex and challenging task. Evaluation must account for social, political, environmental and other conditions, such as flood state expectations and local priorities. The evaluation method should be able to quickly identify evolving investment needs as the incidence and magnitude of flood events continue to grow. Quantification is essential and must consider multiple direct and indirect effects on flood related outcomes. The method proposed is this study is a Bayesian network, which may be used ex-post for evaluation, but also ex-ante for future assessment, and near real-time for the reallocation of investment into interventions. The particular case we study is the effect of flood interventions upon mental health, which is a gap in current investment analyses. Natural events such as floods expose people to negative mental health disorders including anxiety, distress and post-traumatic stress disorder. Such outcomes can be mitigated or exacerbated not only by state funded interventions, but by individual and community skills and experience. Success is also dampened when vulnerable and previously exposed victims are affected. Current measures evaluate solely the effectiveness of interventions to reduce physical damage to people and assets. This paper contributes a design for a Bayesian network that exposes causal pathways and conditional probabilities between interventions and mental health outcomes as well as providing a tool that can readily indicate the level of investment needed in alternative interventions based on desired mental health outcomes."

In this paper, we integrate the quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm with the MOEA/D framework in order to make the QPSO be able to solve MOPs effectively, with the advantage of the QPSO being fully used. We also employ a diversity controlling mechanism to avoid the premature convergence especially at the later stage of the search process, and thus further improve the performance of our proposed algorithm. In addition, we introduce a number of nondominated solutions to generate the global best for guiding other particles in the swarm. Experiments are conducted to compare the proposed algorithm, DMO-QPSO, with four multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithms and one multi-objective evolutionary algorithm on 15 test functions, including both bi-objective and tri-objective problems. The results show that the performance of the proposed DMO-QPSO is better than other five algorithms in solving most of these test problems. Moreover, we further study the impact of two different decomposition approaches, i.e., the penalty-based boundary intersection (PBI) and Tchebycheff (TCH) approaches, as well as the polynomial mutation operator on the algorithmic performance of DMO-QPSO."

      "abstract": "The random drift particle swarm optimization (RDPSO) algorithm is an effective random search technique inspired by the trajectory analysis of the canonical PSO and the free electron model in metal conductors placed in an external electric field. However, like other PSO variants, the RDPSO algorithm also inevitably encounters premature convergence when solving multimodal problems. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel diversity collaboratively guided (DCG) strategy for the RDPSO algorithm that enhances the search ability of the algorithm. In this strategy, two kinds of diversity measures are defined and modified in a collaborative manner. Specifically, the whole search process of the RDPSO is divided into three phases based on the changes in the two diversity measures. In each phase, different values are selected for the key parameters of the update equation in the RDPSO to make the particle swarm perform different search modes. Consequently, the improved RDPSO algorithm with the DCG strategy (DCG-RDPSO) can maintain its diversity dynamically at a certain level, and thus can search constantly without stagnation until the search process terminates. The performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm is done on the CEC-2013 benchmark suite, in comparison with several versions of RDPSO, different variants of PSO and several non-PSO evolutionary algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed DCG strategy can significantly improve the performance and robustness of the RDPSO algorithm for most of the multimodal problems. Further experiments on economic dispatch problems also verify the effectiveness of the DCG strategy."

The algorithm is a variant of Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD) adapted for satisfiability, where solution candidates (sample points) are constructed incrementally, either until a satisfying sample is found or sufficient samples have been sampled to conclude unsatisfiability. The choice of samples is guided by the input constraints and previous conflicts. The key idea behind our new approach is to start with a partial sample; demonstrate that it cannot be extended to a full sample; and from the reasons for that rule out a larger space around the partial sample, which build up incrementally into a cylindrical algebraic covering of the space. There are similarities with the incremental variant of CAD, the NLSAT method of Jovanović and de Moura, and the NuCAD algorithm of Brown; but we present worked examples and experimental results on a preliminary implementation to demonstrate the differences to these, and the benefits of the new approach."

In three dimensions we confirm and extend previous numerical work, showing clearly the first-order character of both the magnetic transition and the polymer collapse, which happen together.

Accessible and non-invasive methods of diagnosing and characterising AD are therefore urgently required. Electroencephalography (EEG) fulfils these criteria and is often used when studying AD. Several features derived from EEG were shown to predict AD with high accuracy, e.g. signal complexity and synchronisation. However, the dynamics of how the brain transitions between stable states have not been properly studied in the case of AD and EEG data. Energy landscape analysis is a method that can be used to quantify these dynamics. This work presents the first application of this method to both AD and EEG. Energy landscape assigns energy value to each possible state, i.e. pattern of activations across brain regions. The energy is inversely proportional to the probability of occurrence. By studying the features of energy landscapes of 20 AD patients and 20 healthy age-matched counterparts, significant differences were found. The dynamics of AD patients' brain networks were shown to be more constrained - with more local minima, less variation in basin size, and smaller basins. We show that energy landscapes can predict AD with high accuracy, performing significantly better than baseline models."

As mono‐sensor systems cannot provide reliable and consistent readings under all circum-stances because of errors and other limitations, fusing data from multiple sensors ensures that the environmental parameters are perceived correctly and reliably for most scenarios, thereby substan-tially improving the reliability of the multi‐sensor‐based automotive systems. This paper first high-lights the significance of efficiently fusing data from multiple sensors in ADAS features. An emergency brake assist (EBA) system is showcased using multiple sensors, namely, a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor and camera. The architectures of the proposed ‘centralised’ and ‘decentral-ised’ sensor fusion approaches for EBA are discussed along with their constituents, i.e., the detection algorithms, the fusion algorithm, and the tracking algorithm. The centralised and decentralised architectures are built and analytically compared, and the performance of these two fusion architectures for EBA are evaluated in terms of speed of execution, accuracy, and computational cost. While both fusion methods are seen to drive the EBA application at an acceptable frame rate (~20fps or higher) on an Intel i5‐based Ubuntu system, it was concluded through the experiments and analyt-ical comparisons that the decentralised fusion‐driven EBA leads to higher accuracy; however, it has the downside of a higher computational cost. The centralised fusion‐driven EBA yields compara-tively less accurate results, but with the benefits of a higher frame rate and lesser computational cost."

      "abstract": "Emerging technologies are playing a critical role in the evolution of healthcare systems by presenting eHealth to provide high-quality services and better health to wide-range of patients. Achieving the eHealth goals highly depends on employing modern information and communication technologies (ICTs) to securely and efficiently collect and transmit electronic health records (EHRs) and make them accessible to authorized users and healthcare providers. However, the adoption of EHRs in healthcare providers puts the patients’ privacy and their information security at risk of data breaches. The advent of smart contracts and blockchain technology paves a way for developing efficient EHR access control methods to support secure identification, authentication, and authorization of the clients. This paper delineates an extensive survey on the state-of-the-art blockchain-based access control methods in healthcare domain as a basis for categorizing the existing and future developments in access control area. A thematic taxonomy of the blockchain-based access control methods is also presented to recognize the security issues of the existing methods and highlight the fundamental security requirements to design a granular access control method. This paper also aims for examining the similarities and differences of the traditional access control methods and describes some substantial and outstanding issues and challenges as further directions."

      "abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder known to affect functional connectivity (FC) across many brain regions. Linear FC measures have been applied to study the differences in AD by splitting neurophysiological signals such as electroencephalography (EEG) recordings into discrete frequency bands and analysing them in isolation from each other. We address this limitation by quantifying cross-frequency FC in addition to the traditional within-band approach. Cross-bispectrum, a higher-order spectral analysis approach, is used to measure the nonlinear FC and is compared with the cross-spectrum, which only measures the linear FC within bands. This work reports the first use of cross-bispectrum to reconstruct a cross-frequency FC network where each frequency band is treated as a layer in a multilayer network with both inter- and intra-layer edges. An increase of within-band FC in AD is observed in low-frequency bands using both methods. Bispectrum also detects multiple cross-frequency differences, mainly increased FC in AD in delta-theta coupling. An increased importance of low-frequency coupling and decreased importance of high-frequency coupling is observed in AD. Integration properties of AD networks are more vulnerable than HC, while the segregation property is maintained in AD. Moreover, the segregation property of γ is less vulnerable in AD, suggesting the shift of importance from high-frequency activity towards low-frequency components. The results highlight the importance of studying nonlinearity and including cross-frequency FC in characterising AD. Moreover, the results demonstrate the advantages and limitations of using bispectrum to reconstruct FC networks."

      "abstract": "In this article, we investigate the potential enhancements in signal reliability which can be achieved using a millimeter-wave distributed antenna system (DAS) within an indoor environment. To achieve this, we measured the signal power simultaneously received at nine ceiling-mounted access point (AP) locations likely to be used in future indoor DAS deployments while a mobile user imitated making a voice call on a hypothetical user equipment. Key metrics, associated with the performance of multiple antenna systems, such as the cross correlation coefficient (CCC) and channel power imbalance (CPI) are determined. It was found that line-of-sight (LOS) and quasi-LOS (QLOS) links with the APs typically led to higher CCC values than the non-LOS (NLOS) cases. Similarly, LOS and QLOS links typically produced higher CPI values between APs than the NLOS case. To enable the reproduction of our results, we have successfully applied autoregressive moving average and autoregressive integrated moving average modeling to the CCC and CPI time series. The performance improvement that can be achieved using a DAS instead of a single AP was evaluated using three commonly deployed diversity combining schemes, namely, selection combining, equal gain combining, and maximal ratio combining along with three AP selection mechanisms, namely, per-sample random AP selection, one-shot AP selection, and per-sample optimal AP selection. Finally, we have provided some useful insight into the influence of differing AP numbers on the diversity gain when considering the aforementioned AP selection methods."

      "abstract": "The unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) concept has attracted the attention of both academia and industry as an alternative to reduce the traffic congestion limitation. To coordinate the UAVs located in the sky, also called drones, the concept of the Internet of Drones (IoD) was introduced as overall coordination of UAVs in the sky. IoD paradigm offers a wide range of applications mainly targeting the military and civilian environments. Some of those applications include transportation, agriculture-based systems, entertainment, weather monitoring, healthcare systems, and road hazards monitoring. However, once an area is highly congested by a various number of drones, dynamic or statics obstacles can hinder the overall performance of drones. In order to avoid those obstacles, one of the proposed solutions is to apply collision avoidance techniques while the drones are on duty. In this paper, we present a brief survey of collision avoidance systems for the internet of drones. We have reviewed the current literature review ranging from the year 2010 to 2021. This work has taken into consideration two main frequently used databases in academia: Xplore for IEEE and ScienceDirect for Elsevier. After article selection, some articles were retained and discussed. A detailed discussion and analysis of selected articles were made while most of the techniques used in collision avoidance systems include video-based systems and swarm-based intelligence approaches. Furthermore, the paper discusses the different approaches which are used to design collision avoidance systems. Finally, this paper provides concluding remarks and future research orientation that will mainly focus on AI-based algorithms applied in collision avoidance systems."

      "abstract": "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are known for their ability to learn relationships within temporal sequences. Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks have found use in challenging time-dependent applications such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), financial analysis and sensor fusion due to their capability to cope with the vanishing gradient problem. GRUs are also known to be more computationally efficient than their variant, the Long Short-Term Memory neural network (LSTM), due to their less complex structure and as such, are more suitable for applications requiring more efficient management of computational resources. Many of such applications require a stronger mapping of their features to further enhance the prediction accuracy. A novel Quaternion Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU) is proposed in this paper, which leverages the internal and external dependencies within the quaternion algebra to map correlations within and across multidimensional features. The QGRU can be used to efficiently capture the inter- and intra-dependencies within multidimensional features unlike the GRU, which only captures the dependencies within the sequence. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated on a sensor fusion problem involving navigation in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) deprived environments as well as a human activity recognition problem. The results obtained show that the QGRU produces competitive results with almost 3.7 times fewer parameters compared to the GRU. The QGRU code is available at https://github.com/onyekpeu/Quarternion-Gated-Recurrent-Unit."

      "abstract": "The reuse of load-bearing building components has the potential to promote the circular economy in the building sector. One recent aspect of the efforts to improve reuse rates in buildings is estimating the reusability of the structural elements. This study develops a probabilistic predictive model using advanced supervised machine learning methods to evaluate the economic reusability of the load-bearing building elements. The results of sensitivity analysis and visualization techniques used in this study reveal that the most important economic factor is the need to purchase reused elements early in a project, which could have cash flow implications. The other most important factors are the potential financial risks, the procurement process, and the labour cost. This study unveils that the relationship between variables is not linear, and none of the identified factors could alone determine if an element is reusable or not. This study concludes that the complex interdependencies of factors affecting reuse cause a high level of uncertainty about the feasibility of reusing the load-bearing building structural components from an economic aspect. Nonetheless, this paper reveals that by using the probability theory foundations and combining it with advanced supervised machine learning methods, it is possible to develop tools that could reliably estimate the economic reusability of these elements based on affecting variables. Therefore, the authors suggest utilizing the approach developed in this research to promote the circularity of materials in different subsectors of the construction industry."

Many factors and constraints need to be considered when modelling this storage allocation problem. These constraints include the size, type and weight of the containers. The factors are the number of containers in a stack and the duration of stay of the topmost container in the stack. This paper aims to develop an improved Fuzzy Knowledge-Based ‘FKB’ model for best allocation\npractice of long-stay containers in a yard. In this model, the duration of stay factor does not need to be considered in the allocation decision if the duration of stay for the topmost containers in a stack is similar; hence, a new ‘ON/OFF’ strategy is proposed within the Fuzzy Knowledge-Based model to activate/deactivate this factor in the stacking algorithm whenever is required. Discrete Event Simulation and Fuzzy Knowledge-Based techniques are used to develop the proposed model. The model’s behaviour is tested using three real-life scenarios, including allocating containers in busy, moderately busy and quiet yards. The total number of re-handlings, the number of re-handlings per stack, and the number of re-handlings for containers were considered KPIs in each scenario."

      "abstract": "Satellite image segmentation is an important topic in many domains. This paper introduces a novel semi-supervised image segmentation method for satellite image segmentation. Unlike the semantic segmentation strategies, this method requires only limited labelled data from small local patches of satellite images. Due to the complexity and large number of land cover objects in satellite images, a fixed-size square window is used for feature extraction from 7 different local areas. The local features are extracted by spectral domain analysis. Then, classification is performed based on similarity of the local features to those of the\n7 labelled patches. This also allows efficient selection of the suitable window scale. Furthermore, the labeled features remove the need for iterative clustering for decision making about features. The labelled data also allows learning a subspace of transformed features for segmentation of water and green area based on simple thresholding. Comparison of the segmentation results using the\nproposed strategy compared to unsupervised techniques such as k-means clustering and Superpixel-based Fast Fuzzy C-Means Clustering (SFFCM) shows the superiority of the proposed strategy in terms of content-based segmentation."

These associated uncertainties occur because the arrival of a truck to pick up the container is random, so the departure time of the container is unknown. The problem investigated in this paper emerges when newly arrived containers of different sizes, types and weights require storage operation in the same yard where other containers have already been stored. This situation becomes more challenging when the time of departure of existing container is not known. This study develops a new Fuzzy Knowledge-Based optimisation system named ‘FKB_GA’ for optimal storage and retrieval of containers in a yard that contains long stay pre-existing containers. The containers’ duration of stay factor is considered along with two other factors such as the similarity (containers with same customer) and the quantity of containers per stack.\nA new Multi-Layered Genetic Algorithm module is proposed which identifies the optimal fuzzy rules required for each set of fired rules to achieve a minimum number of container re-handlings when selecting a stack. An industrial case study is used to demonstrate the applicability and practicability of the developed system."

Given that off-grid solar streetlights produce surplus energy, we hypothesized that this energy could be made available for daily usage, to improve system performance and provide further energy access to displaced populations. We recognize, however, that solar streetlight performance and longevity have typically been poor in remote and refugee settings. Eleven solar streetlights were fitted with ground-level sockets and their performance monitored, in two displaced settlements: a refugee camp in Rwanda and an internally displaced population settlement in Nepal. Considerable performance gaps were found across all eleven systems. Inefficient lights and mismatching system components were major issues at both sites, reducing targeted designed performance ratios by 33% and 53% on average in Rwanda and Nepal, respectively. The challenges of deploying these types of systems in temporary settlements are outlined and a number of suggestions are made to guide future developments in the design and implementation of sustainable solar streetlight interventions."

This work makes use of an unsupervised learning method, called hierarchical clustering, in an attempt to create an artificial sensor to detect two different cyber-sabotage cases, known as false data injection and denial-of-service, during the dynamic behavior of the power system. The detection process is conducted by using an unsupervised learning-enhanced approach, and a decision tree regressor is then employed for removing the threat. The dynamic state estimation of the power system is done by Kalman filters, which provide benefits in terms of the speed and accuracy of the process. Measurement devices in utilities and buses are vulnerable to communication interruptions between phasor measurement units and operators, who can be easily manipulated by false data. While Kalman filters are incapable of detecting the majority of such cyber-attacks, this article proves that the proposed unsupervised machine learning method is able to detect more than 90 percent of the mentioned attacks. The simulation results on the IEEE 9-bus with 3-machines and IEEE 14-bus with 5-machines systems verify the efficiency of the proposed approach."

The algorithms based on Markov random field (MRF) have shown strong abilities in dealing with noisy image segmentation compared to other methods. In this article, inspired by the random drift particle swarm optimization (RDPSO) algorithm, we propose a novel hybrid framework based on a combination of the RDPSO with the hidden MRF model and the expectation–maximization algorithm (HMRF-EM), to be used for MRI segmentation in real-time environments. The proposed hybrid framework is compared with the standalone HMRF-EM method, two other MRF-based stochastic relaxation algorithms, and two widely used brain tissue segmentation toolboxes on both simulated and real MRI datasets. The experimental results prove that the proposed hybrid framework can obtain better segmentation results than most of its competitors and has faster convergence speed than the compared stochastic optimization algorithms."

Hence, a fully parallel architecture for the SOM is introduced to optimize the system’s data processing time. Unlike most literature approaches, the architecture proposed here does not contain sequential steps - a common limiting factor for processing speed. The architecture was validated on FPGA and evaluated concerning hardware throughput and the use of resources. Comparisons to the state of the art show a speedup of 8.91x over a partially serial implementation, using less than 15% of hardware resources available.

This paper aims at eliminating the respective challenges to ensure the reliability of the decision-making process. To this aim, we first propose a novel deep learning method to simultaneously eliminate these challenges and predict the patients' survival chance. Secondly, a hybrid framework is designed that contains three main modules for missing data imputation, class imbalance learning, and classification, each of which employing multiple advanced techniques for the given task. Furthermore, these two approaches are compared and evaluated using a real clinical case study.

Using the time series data, the localized cross correlation coefficient (CCC) was subsequently estimated from the raw received signal strength (RSS) using the Spearman's rank-order correlation. It was found that the resultant time series of the localized CCCs was well-described by the Gaussian distribution across all of the considered measurement scenarios. Moreover, it was observed that the line-of-sight (LOS) and quasi-LOS (QLOS) paths typically led to higher CCC values with broader spreads than the non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios. To study the potential for signal enhancement by using diversity combining in mmWave DASs, we applied selection combining, equal gain combining and maximal ratio combining before investigating the AP selection mechanisms. Finally, we provide some useful insights into the influence of differing AP numbers on the diversity gain when considering the aforementioned AP selection methods."

      "abstract": "In this paper, inspired from the idea that the contextual distances and positions may have a substantial impact on distinguishing the relationships between words, a novel word association method with two weighting schemes for refining contexts, named as Weighted Point-wise Mutual Information with Contextual Distances and Positions (PMIDP), is proposed to eliminate the noisy and redundant information hidden in an imbalanced corpus. One weighting scheme, called PMIdist, revises the Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI) method by scaling the co-occurrence counts according to the distance between a word and the context. The second weighting scheme is a ratio that can measure the contextual position variation within the window of a given word. Then, the refined word association in PMIDP is defined as the multiplication of the two proposed weighting schemes, which essentially aims to flexibly adjust the word association when solving target-oriented similarity tasks. The proposed word association method has been applied on two widely known models, i.e., the positive PMI matrix with truncated Singular Vector Decomposition (PPMI-SVD) model and the Global Vectors (GloVe) model. Experimental results demonstrate that the PMIDP method can significantly improve the performances of the two models on both semantic and relational similarity tasks and show advantages when compared with other state-of-the-art models."

      "abstract": "This paper presents a method to model and optimise the substrate feeding rate of an anaerobic digestion (AD) system. The method is demonstrated for a case study plant in Bangalore, India, using onsite kitchen waste to provide biogas for cooking. The AD system is modelled using Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) and a genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to control the substrate feeding rate in order to simultaneously minimise the volume of flared biogas, unmet gas demand and energy cost. Our results show that ADM1 can predict biogas yield from a continuously operated digester well with mean percentage error between daily predicted and measured data values of only 5.7% for March 2017 and 17.8% for July 2017. When biogas flaring and unmet gas demand were minimised, the amount of biogas flared reduced from 886.62 m3 to 88.87 m3 in March and from 73.79 m3 to 68.49 m3 in July. When the energy cost was also considered within an objective function, the biogas flared reduced from 886.62 m3 to 281.27 m3 for March, but increased from 73.79 m3 to 180.11 m3 for July. The amount of flaring increased in July as the energy cost function increased biogas yield without considering surplus gas production beyond demand and storage capacity. As AD systems are often operated to maximise biogas production, these results highlight the need for multi-objective optimisation, particularly for off-grid AD systems."

      "abstract": "The emergence of new nanoscale technologies has imposed significant challenges to designing reliable electronic systems in radiation environments. A few types of radiation like Total Ionizing Dose (TID) effects often cause permanent damages on such nanoscale electronic devices, and current state-of-the-art technologies to tackle TID make use of expensive radiation-hardened devices. This paper focuses on a novel and different approach: using machine learning algorithms on consumer electronic level Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to tackle TID effects and monitor them to replace before they stop working. This condition has a research challenge to anticipate when the board results in a total failure due to TID effects. We observed internal measurements of the FPGA boards under gamma radiation and used three different anomaly detection machine learning (ML) algorithms to detect anomalies in the sensor measurements in a gamma-radiated environment. The statistical results show a highly significant relationship between the gamma radiation exposure levels and the board measurements. Moreover, our anomaly detection results have shown that a One-Class Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function Kernel has an average Recall score of 0.95. Also, all anomalies can be detected before the boards stop working."

It is one of the leading causes of temporary visual disability and permanent blindness. There is no cure for this disease other than a proper treatment in the early stages. Five stages of diabetic retinopathy are discussed in this paper that need to be detected followed by a proper treatment. Transfer learning is used to detect the grades of diabetic retinopathy in eye fundus images, without training from scratch. The Kaggle EyePACS dataset is one of the largest datasets\navailable publicly for experimentation. In our work, an extensive study on the Kaggle EyePACS dataset is carried out using pre-trained models ResNet50 and DenseNet121. The Aptos dataset is also used in comparison with this dataset to examine the performance of the pre-trained models. Different experiments are performed to analyze the images from the different classes in the Kaggle EyePACS dataset. This dataset has significant challenges including image noise, imbalanced classes, and fault annotations. Our work highlights potential problems within the dataset\nand the conflicts between the classes. A clustering technique is used to get informative images from the normal class to improve the model’s accuracy to 70%."

Increased use of AI, whilst improving safety, productivity, and sustainability of energy systems, will become increasingly complex with high computational demands. This raises ethical concerns around issues such as security and privacy. While there is a strong culture of regulatory compliance, there is a significantly less established understanding of ethical practices and frameworks in the UK energy sector.\n\nThis briefing paper details work conducted by EnergyREV researchers exploring understanding and experience of ethics and AI, as the sector moves towards greater employment of technology in the data collection, storage and use processes. By addressing ethical concerns from the outset, taking a proactive rather than reactive approach, risks can be mitigated, and potential issues addressed early on, leading to more opportunities for technological advancement and innovation.\n\nThrough engagement with energy actors, an understanding of how ethics is applied by those working in the energy data sector will be improved"

The legal requirement on adoption agencies to consider ethnicity in the decision around 'matching' was removed, thus clearing the way for transracial placements. This article interrogates the impact of the change in law on social work practice around adoption, using the experiences of diverse Muslim-heritage children as a case study. Grounded in the sociology of religion, the findings presented here are based on semi-structured qualitative interviews (n=28) with those involved in the care of Muslim-heritage children. In discussing qualitative findings, all adopters and prospective adopters interviewed in this research insisted on adopting children who 'look like them', and social workers continued to look for the 'best' possible matches. Children from minoritised backgrounds continue to wait for long periods before finding permanent homes. Our evidence raises questions about the efficacy of policy guidance. Based on this evidence we conclude that greater strategizing is needed around the recruitment of adopters from diverse backgrounds."

      "abstract": "Modern cars utilise Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) in several ways. In ADAS, the use of multiple sensors to gauge the environment surrounding the ego-vehicle offers numerous advantages, as fusing information from more than one sensor helps to provide highly reliable and error-free data. The fused data is typically then fed to a tracker algorithm, which helps to reduce noise and compensate for situations when received sensor data is temporarily absent or spurious, or to counter the offhand false positives and negatives. The performances of these constituent algorithms vary vastly under different scenarios. In this paper, we focus on the variation in the performance of tracker algorithms in sensor fusion due to the alteration in external conditions in different scenarios, and on the methods for countering that variation. We introduce a sensor fusion architecture, where the tracking algorithm is spontaneously switched to achieve the utmost performance under all scenarios. By employing a Real-time Traffic Density Estimation (RTDE) technique, we may understand whether the ego-vehicle is currently in dense or sparse traffic conditions. A highly dense traffic (or congested traffic) condition would mean that external circumstances are non-linear; similarly, sparse traffic conditions would mean that the probability of linear external conditions would be higher. We also employ a Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) algorithm, which is able to monitor for construction zones, junctions, schools, and pedestrian crossings, thereby identifying areas which have a high probability of spontaneous, on-road occurrences. Based on the results received from the RTDE and TSR algorithms, we construct a logic which switches the tracker of the fusion architecture between an Extended Kalman Filter (for linear external scenarios) and an Unscented Kalman Filter (for non-linear scenarios). This ensures that the fusion model always uses the tracker that is best suited for its current needs, thereby yielding consistent accuracy across multiple external scenarios, compared to the fusion models that employ a fixed single tracker."

      "abstract": "In many applied sciences, the main aim is to learn the parameters in the operational equations which best fit the observed data. A framework for solving such problems is to employ Gaussian process (GP) emulators which are well-known as nonparametric Bayesian machine learning techniques. GPs are among a class of methods known as kernel machines which can be used to approximate rather complex problems by tuning their hyperparameters. The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) has widely been used to estimate the parameters of the operators and kernels. However, the MLE-based and Bayesian inference in the standard form are usually involved in setting up a covariance matrix which is generally ill-conditioned. As a result, constructing and inverting the covariance matrix using the standard form will become unstable to learn the parameters in the operational equations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to tackle these computational complexities and also resolve the ill-conditioning problem by forming the covariance matrix using alternative bases via the Hilbert−Schmidt SVD (HS-SVD) approach. Applying this approach yields a novel matrix factorization of the block-structured covariance matrix which can be implemented stably by isolating the main source of the ill-conditioning. In contrast to standard matrix decompositions which start with a matrix and produce the resulting factors, the HS-SVD is constructed from the Hilbert−Schmidt eigenvalues and eigenvectors without the need to ever form the potentially ill-conditioned matrix. We also provide stable MLE and Bayesian inference to adaptively estimate hyperparameters, and the corresponding operators can then be efficiently predicted at some new points using the proposed HS-SVD bases. The efficiency and stability of the proposed HS-SVD method will be compared with the existing methods by several illustrations of the parametric linear equations, such as ordinary and partial differential equations, and integro-differential and fractional order operators."

The grid under study is a DC microgrid with distributed boost converters, where the false data are injected into the voltage data so as to investigate the effect of attacks. The proposed algorithm uses a bank of sliding mode observers that estimates the states of the neighbor agents. Each agent estimates the neighboring states and, according to the estimation and communication data, the detection mechanism reveals the presence of FDIA. The proposed control scheme provides resiliency to the system by replacing the conventional consensus rule with attack-resilient ones. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method, a real-time simulation with eight agents has been performed. Moreover, a verification experimental test with three boost converters has been utilized to confirm the simulation results. It is shown that the proposed algorithm is able to detect FDI attacks and it protects the consensus deviation against FDI attacks."

      "abstract": "Protein-ligand docking is of great importance to drug design, since it can predict the binding affinity between ligand and protein, and guide the synthesis direction of the lead compounds. Over the past few decades, various docking programs have been developed, some of them employing novel optimization algorithms. However, most of those methods cannot simultaneously achieve both good efficiency and accuracy. Therefore, it is worthwhile to pour the efforts into the development of a docking program with fast speed and high quality of the solutions obtained. The research presented in this paper, based on the docking scheme of Vina, developed a novel docking program called RDPSOVina. The RDPSOVina employes a novel search algorithm but the same scoring function of Vina. It utilizes the random drift particle swarm optimization (RDPSO) algorithm as the global search algorithm, implements the local search with small probability, and applies Markov chain mutation to the particles' personal best positions in order to harvest more potential-candidates. To prove the outstanding docking performance in RDPSOVina, we performed the re-docking experiments on two PDBbind datasets and cross-docking experiments on the Sutherland-crossdock-set, respectively. The RDPSOVina exhibited superior protein-ligand docking accuracy and better cross-docking prediction with higher operation efficiency than most of the compared methods.

      "abstract": "With the development of autonomous vehicles, localization and mapping technologies have become crucial to equip the vehicle with the appropriate knowledge for its operation. In this paper, we extend our previous work by prepossessing a localization and mapping architecture for autonomous vehicles that do not rely on GPS, particularly in environments such as tunnels, under bridges, urban canyons, and dense tree canopies. The proposed approach is of two parts. Firstly, a K-means algorithm is employed to extract features from LiDAR scenes to create a local map of each scan. Then, we concatenate the local maps to create a global map of the environment and facilitate data association between frames. Secondly, the main localization task is performed by an adaptive particle filter that works in four steps: (a) generation of particles around an initial state (provided by the GPS); (b) updating the particle positions by providing the motion (translation and rotation) of the vehicle using an inertial measurement device; (c) selection of the best candidate particles by observing at each timestamp the match rate (also called particle weight) of the local map (with the real-time distances to the objects) and the distances of the particles to the corresponding chunks of the global map; (d) averaging the selected particles to derive the estimated position, and, finally, using a resampling method on the particles to ensure the reliability of the position estimation. The performance of the newly proposed technique is investigated on different sequences of the Kitti and Pandaset raw data with different environmental setups, weather conditions, and seasonal changes. The obtained results validate the performance of the proposed approach in terms of speed and representativeness of the feature extraction for real-time localization in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods."

However, information security and privacy protection are important challenges particularly for smart vehicles in smart cities that have attracted the attention of experts in this domain. Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) endeavor to mitigate the risk of privacy invasions, but the literature lacks a thorough review of the approaches and techniques that support individuals' privacy in the connection between smart vehicles and smart cities. This gap has stimulated us to conduct this research with the main goal of reviewing recent privacy-enhancing technologies, approaches, taxonomy, challenges, and solutions on the application of PETs for smart vehicles in smart cities. The significant aspect of this study originates from the inclusion of data-oriented and process-oriented privacy protection. This research also identifies limitations of existing PETs, complementary technologies, and potential research directions."

      "abstract": "Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) are gaining increasing importance due to the current needs of modern society for better mobility and societal impact. CAV development and adoption will be driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and 5G/6G technologies which will offer increased speed, reduced latency and ubiquity. However, the public is concerned with the concept of handing total control of driving to vehicles. These concerns will inhibit the adoption of CAVs when they become available to the public. In this paper, we investigated user adoption of CAVs by collecting quantitative data from potential users based on their preference and inherent concerns towards adoption. We conducted a statistical analysis and applied machine learning techniques to predict the user adoption for CAVs. Our results show that several machine learning approaches were effective in forecasting user adoption for CAVs. We have employed Neural Networks, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes and Fuzzy Logic based models and achieved accuracies of 81.76%, 83.63%, 82.15% and 86.38, respectively, in forecasting the public adoption of CAV."

      "abstract": "The prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is essential to understand the cellular processes from a medical perspective. Among the various machine learning techniques, kernel-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been commonly employed to discriminate between interacting and non-interacting protein pairs. The main drawback of employing the kernel-based SVM to datasets with many features, such as the primary sequence-based protein-protein dataset, is the significant increase in computational time of training stage. This increase in computational time is mainly due to the presence of the kernel in solving the quadratic optimisation problem (QOP) involved in nonlinear SVM. In order to fix this issue, we propose a novel and efficient computational algorithm by approximating the kernel-based SVM using a low-rank truncated Mercer series as well as desired. As a result, the QOP for the approximated kernel-based SVM will be very tractable in the sense that there is a significant reduction in computational time of training and validating stages. We illustrate the novelty of the proposed method by predicting the PPIs of \"S. Cerevisiae” where the protein features extracted using the multiscale local descriptor (MLD), and then we compare the predictive performance of the proposed low-rank approximation with the existing methods. Finally, the new method results in significant reduction in computational time for predicting PPIs with almost as accuracy as kernel-based SVM"

Over the past few decades, great efforts have been made for the development of novel docking programs with great efficiency and intriguing accuracy. AutoDock Vina (Vina) is one of these achievements with improved speed and accuracy compared to AutoDock4. Since it was proposed, some of its variants, such as PSOVina and GWOVina, have also been developed. However, for all these docking programs, there is still large room for performance improvement.\n\nResults:\nIn this work, we propose a parallel multi-swarm cooperative particle swarm model, in which one master swarm and several slave swarms mutually cooperate and co-evolve. Our experiments show that multi-swarm programs possess better docking robustness than PSOVina. Moreover, the multi-swarm program based on random drift PSO can achieve the best highest accuracy of protein–ligand docking, an outstanding enrichment effect for drug-like activate compounds, and the second best AUC screening accuracy among all the compared docking programs, but with less computation consumption than most of the other docking programs.\n\nConclusion:\nThe proposed multi-swarm cooperative model is a novel algorithmic modeling suitable for protein–ligand docking and virtual screening. Owing to the existing coevolution between the master and the slave swarms, this model in parallel generates remarkable docking performance.

The scalability is characterised by the joint boundaries of device density and traffic intensity per device. Novel cross-correlation factors are used to quantify imperfect SF-orthogonality. Our results show that a proper characterisation of LoRa orthogonality extends the scalability of the network. They also highlight that for low/medium densities decreasing the SF extends the spanned spectrum of sensing applications characterised by their traffic requirements (i.e., sensing rate). However, for high density (>104 nodes/Km2), the Pareto frontiers converge to a stability limit governed by the SF allocation scheme and the predefined capture thresholds. The results further evince the importance of capturing threshold distribution among the SFs to mitigate the unfair latency."

      "abstract": "Background: Many physical, biological and neural systems behave as coupled oscillators, with characteristic phase coupling across different frequencies. Methods such as n:m phase locking value (where two coupling frequencies are linked as: mf1=nf2) and bi-phase locking value have previously been proposed to quantify phase coupling between two resonant frequencies (e.g. f,2f/3) and across three frequencies (e.g. f1,f2,f1+f2), respectively. However, the existing phase coupling metrics have their limitations and limited applications. They cannot be used to detect or quantify phase coupling across multiple frequencies (e.g. f1,f2,f3,f4,f1+f2+f3-f4), or coupling that involves non-integer multiples of the frequencies (e.g. f1,f2,2f1/3+f2/3). New methods: To address the gap, this paper proposes a generalized approach, named multi-phase locking value (M-PLV), for the quantification of various types of instantaneous multi-frequency phase coupling. Different from most instantaneous phase coupling metrics that measure the simultaneous phase coupling, the proposed M-PLV method also allows the detection of delayed phase coupling and the associated time lag between coupled oscillators. Results: The M-PLV has been tested on cases where synthetic coupled signals are generated using white Gaussian signals, and a system comprised of multiple coupled Rössler oscillators, as well as a human subject dataset. Results indicate that the M-PLV can provide a reliable estimation of the time window and frequency combination where the phase coupling is significant, as well as a precise determination of time lag in the case of delayed coupling. This method has the potential to become a powerful new tool for exploring phase coupling in complex nonlinear dynamic systems."

As an alternative method to solving the Fokker−Planck equation, we propose a new method to calculate time-dependent probability density functions (PDFs) and to study Information Geometry using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of SDEs. Specifically, we develop a new MC SDE method to overcome the challenges in calculating a time-dependent PDF and information geometric diagnostics and to speed up simulations by utilizing GPU computing. Using MC SDE simulations, we reproduce Information Geometric scaling relations found from the Fokker−Planck method for the case of a stochastic process with linear and cubic damping terms. We showcase the advantage of MC SDE simulation over FPE solvers by calculating unequal time joint PDFs. For the linear process with a linear damping force, joint PDF is found to be a Gaussian. In contrast, for the cubic process with a cubic damping force, joint PDF exhibits a bimodal structure, even in a stationary state. This suggests a finite memory time induced by a nonlinear force. Furthermore, several power-law scalings in the characteristics of bimodal PDFs are identified and investigated."

We design the generation time of updates for nodes and develop transmission schedules under both protocol and physical interference models, aiming at achieving minimum peak AoI and average AoI among all nodes for a given time duration. We prove that it is an NP-Hard problem and propose an energy-adaptive, distributed algorithm called MAoIG. We derive its theoretical upper bounds for the peak and average AoI and a lower bound for peak AoI. The numerical results validate that MAoIG outperforms all of the baseline schemes in all scenarios and that the experimental results tightly track the theoretical upper bound optimal solutions while the lower bound tightness decreases with the number of nodes."

      "abstract": "Thermal energy storage offers numerous benefits by reducing energy consumption and promoting the use of renewable energy sources. Thermal energy storage materials have been investigated for many decades with the aim of improving the overall efficiency of energy systems. However, finding solid materials that meet the requirement of high heat capacity has been a grand challenge for material scientists. Herewith, by training various machine learning models on 3377 high-quality data from full density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we efficiently search for potential materials with high heat capacity. We build four traditional machine learning models and two graph neural network models. Cross-comparison of the prediction performance and model accuracy was conducted among different models. The deeperGATGNN model exhibits high prediction accuracy and is used for predicting the heat capacity of 32,026 structures screened from the open quantum material database. We gain deep insight into the correlation between heat capacity and structure descriptors such as space group, prototype, lattice volume, atomic weight, etc. Twenty-two structures were predicted to possess high heat capacity, and the results were further validated with DFT calculations. We also identified one special structure, namely, MnIn2Se4, with space group no. 227 (Fd3¯ m), that exhibits extremely high heat capacity, even higher than that of the Dulong-Petit limit at room temperature. This study paves the way for accelerating the discovery of novel thermal energy storage materials by combining machine learning with minimal DFT inquiry."

      "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs which play a significant role in several biological processes. Accurate identification and sub-classification of lncRNAs is crucial for exploring their characteristic functions in the genome as most coding potential computation (CPC) tools fail to accurately identify, classify and predict their biological functions in plant species. In this study, a novel computational framework called LncRNA identification and function prediction tool (LIFT) has been developed, which implements least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) optimisation and iterative random forests classification for selection of optimal features, a novel position-based classification (PBC) method for sub-classifying lncRNAs into different classes, and a Bayesian-based function prediction approach for annotating lncRNA transcripts. Using LASSO, LIFT selected 31 optimal features and achieved a 15-30% improvement in the prediction accuracy on plant species when evaluated against state-of-the-art CPC tools. Using PBC, LIFT successfully identified the intergenic and antisense transcripts with greater accuracy in the A. thaliana and Z. mays datasets."

These challenges can be dealt with by using different techniques for semantic representation, such as word embedding methods. In addition, approaches for reducing the diversity in Arabic morphologies can also be employed, for example using appropriate word normalisation for Arabic texts. Deep learning has proven to be very popular in solving different NLP tasks in recent years as well. This paper proposes an approach that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to improve sentiment classification, by excluding the max-pooling layer from the CNN. This layer reduces the length of generated feature vectors after convolving the filters on the input data. As such, the LSTM networks will receive well-captured vectors from the feature maps. In addition, the paper investigated different effective approaches for preparing and representing the text features in order to increase the accuracy of Arabic sentiment classification."

We consider here parametrized systems of polynomial equations that are linear in enough parameters, and provide a Kac-Rice formula for the expected number of solutions of the system when the parameters follow continuous distributions. Combined with Monte Carlo integration, we apply the formula to partition the parameter region according to the number of solutions or find a region in parameter space where the system has the maximal number of solutions. The motivation stems from the study of steady states of chemical reaction networks and gives new tools for the open problem of identifying the parameter region where the network has at least two positive steady states. We illustrate with numerous examples that our approach successfully handles a larger number of parameters than exact methods."

      "abstract": "The continuous integration of renewable energy sources into power networks is causing a paradigm shift in energy generation and distribution with regard to trading and control. The intermittent nature of renewable sources affects the pricing of energy sold or purchased. The networks are subject to operational constraints, voltage limits at each node, rated capacities for the power electronic devices, and current bounds for distribution lines. These economic and technical constraints, coupled with intermittent renewable injection, may pose a threat to system stability and performance. In this article, we propose a novel holistic approach to energy trading composed of a distributed predictive control framework to handle physical interactions, i.e., voltage constraints and power dispatch, together with a negotiation framework to determine pricing policies for energy transactions. We study the effect of forecasting generation and consumption on the overall network's performance and market behaviors. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis for both the negotiation framework and the distributed control. Finally, we assess the impact of forecasting in the proposed system with the aid of testing scenarios."

Since the human factor is the preeminent cause behind the traffic accidents, the development of reliable Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADASs) and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is seen by many as a possible solution to improve road safety. ADASs rely on the car perception system input that consists of camera(s), LIDAR and/or radar to detect pedestrians and other objects on the road. Hardware improvements as well as advances done in employing Deep Learning techniques for object detection popularized the Convolutional Neural Networks in the area of autonomous driving research and applications. However, the availability of quality and large datasets continues to be a most important issue that influences the Deep Learning based model’s performance. With this in mind, this work analyses how a YOLO-based object detection architecture responded to limited data available for training and containing low-quality images. The work focused on pedestrian detection, since vulnerable road user’s safety is a major concern within AV and ADAS research communities. The proposed model was trained and tested on data gathered from Coventry, United Kingdom, city streets. The results show that the original YOLOv3 implementation reaches a 42.18 % average precision (AP), and the main challenge was in detecting small objects. Network modifications were made and our final model, based on the original YOLOv3 implementation, achieved 51.6 % AP. It is also demonstrated that the employed data augmentation approach is responsible for doubling the average precision of the final model."

      "abstract": "Despite efforts to promote universal access to electrification, the Brazilian Amazon basin has around 82,000 families without electricity. The basin is huge, with few roads, many rivers, and conservative areas, which is an enormous challenge in terms of logistics and electrification costs. This paper describes a case study at the Nova Esperança community site in the Cuieiras River, Brazil. The community received stand-alone solar photovoltaic systems in 2018 and 2019. The process started with a survey and finished with an interview with each dweller that received a 975 W and 2-day autonomy photovoltaic system. A monitoring system was developed and deployed, and weather monitoring was performed to evaluate the impact of high temperatures on the equipment. The community does not have cell phone coverage and it is far from the main cities. We claim that the model created and adopted in the case study has interesting outcomes, even considering a small budget. Some houses, after 1 year of deployment, had their electrical demand rise by 300%, and 50% improved their income. We estimate the number of greenhouse gases annually avoided after electrification, replacing the consumed fossil fuel. The project also estimates the expenditure on energy sources that residents used due to the lack of electricity, which they stopped doing after electrification. The avoided expense can cover maintenance costs over the years. The goals of the SDG that were covered by the project are good health and well-being, accessible and clean energy, sustainable cities and communities, combating climate change, and partnerships for the goals."

In flood modelling, many hydraulic and hydrodynamic numerical models, especially when operating at high spatiotemporal resolutions, have prohibitively high computational costs for tasks requiring the instantaneous generation of very large numbers of simulation results. This study examines the appropriateness and robustness of Gaussian Process (GP) models to emulate the results from a hydraulic inundation model. The developed GPs produce real-time predictions based on the simulation output from LISFLOOD-FP numerical model. An efficient dimensionality reduction scheme is developed to tackle the high dimensionality of the output space and is combined with the GPs to investigate the predictive performance of the proposed emulator for estimation of the inundation depth. The developed GP-based framework is capable of robust and straightforward quantification of the uncertainty associated with the predictions, without requiring additional model evaluations and simulations. Further, this study explores the computational advantages of using a GP-based emulator over alternative methodologies such as neural networks, by undertaking a comparative analysis. For the case study data presented in this paper, the GP model was found to accurately reproduce water depths and inundation extent by classification and produce computational speedups of approximately 10,000 times compared with the original simulator, and 80 times for a neural network-based emulator."

      "abstract": "Our planet is currently in the midst of a global humanitarian crisis. Yet, there is a widening gap between over 80 million displaced people and the political will to meet their needs. Improving energy access in the displaced setting to build capacity and resilience requires meaningful integration of the needs of communities throughout the design, delivery and evaluation process within the socio-technical energy system. This paper aims to explore the ways in which co-design is conceptualised and applied, from an interdisciplinary perspective, within the socio-technical framing. We do this by first conducting a rapid review of relevant co-design literature to understand theories, typologies and identify methods of best co-design practice in the Humanitarian Energy sector. Second, we present the Humanitarian Engineering and Energy for Displacement project as a co-design case study for Humanitarian Energy using Technology Implementation Model for Energy (TIME) as a framework for analysis. Our rapid review resulted in the typology of the Spectrum of Co-Design, a mapping of differing conceptualisations of co-design showing their positioning and interactions. Our results show that by exploring if and how conceptual frameworks, such as TIME, adds value to practitioner orientated humanitarian programming this can make a significant contribution to future proofing energy systems that seek to deliver inclusive, sustainable and just transitions. We highlight specific learnings from HEED around the disconnection between perceptions of key stakeholder roles, misunderstandings of energy access and use, and building trusting partnerships through the creation of meaningful rectification pathways."

Methods such as generating binary trees representing mathematical expressions or created randomly in a recursive manner from a set of available function symbols, variables and constants have been discussed. However, these generated expressions do not represent a realistic dataset that draws from the typical Maple user’s experience.\n\nI propose a framework for generating valid mathematical expressions. More precisely, the focus will be on integrable expressions. The difference from other methods lies in the fact that the data generation method will be based on a test suite of data generated from Maple users. Thus, the new synthetic data will have properties similar to integrable expressions that Maple users would typically try. This data generation method will be used to train machine learning models that make efficient choices algorithm selection problems."

We then ran interviews with students after the end of the module to produce qualitative data on perceptions of what feedback is, how useful it is, the uses made of it, and how it bears on engagement. A general finding was that human and automated feedback are different but complementary. However there are different feedback needs by group. Our findings imply: (1) that a blended human-automated feedback approach improves engagement; and (2) that this approach needs to be differentiated according to type of student. We give implications for the design of feedback for programming modules."

      "abstract": "Car-cabin thermal systems, including heated seats, air-conditioning, and radiant panels, use a large proportion of the energy budget of electric vehicles and thus reduce their effective range. Optimising these systems and their controllers might be possible with computationally efficient simulation. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art simulators are either too slow or provide little resolution of the cabin's thermal environment. In this work, we propose a novel approach to developing a fast simulation by machine learning (ML) from measurements within the car cabin over a number of trials within a climatic wind tunnel. A range of ML approaches are tried and compared. The best-performing ML approach is compared to more traditional 1D simulation in terms of accuracy and speed. The resulting simulation, based on Multivariate Linear Regression, is fast (5 microseconds per simulation second), and yields good accuracy (NRMSE 1.8%), which exceeds the performance of the traditional 1D simulator. Furthermore, the simulation is able to differentially simulate the thermal environment of the footwell versus the head and the driver position versus the front passenger seat, but unlike a traditional 1D model cannot support changes to the physical structure.\nThis fast method for obtaining computationally efficient simulators of car cabins will accelerate adoption of techniques such as Deep Reinforcement Learning for climate control."

Sensitivity analysis was conducted using partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) and Sobol method to determine influential model parameters. Sensitivity analysis was performed at different significant time points relevant to diabetes dynamics. Our sensitivity analysis was focused on the model parameters for glucose homeostasis system, at 3 to 4 hour time interval, when the system returns to homeostasis after food uptake. PRCC and Sobol method showed that insulin clearance and absorption rates were influential parameters in determining the model response variables at all time points at which sensitivity analysis was performed. PRCC method also showed the model subcutaneous bolus injection term to be important, thus identified all parameters in as influential in determining diabetes model dynamics. Sobol method complemented the sensitivity analysis by identifying relationships between parameters. Sensitivity analysis methods concurred in identifying some of the influential parameters and demonstrated that parameters which are influential remain so at every time point. The concurrence of both PRCC and Sobol methods in identifying influential parameters (in ) and their dynamic relationships highlight the importance of statistical and mathematical analytic approaches in understanding the processes modelled by the parameters in the glucose homeostasis system."

Exploring these types of algorithms provides solutions that are usable, or near optimal, but not exact which reduces the computational cost for the set covering problem.

We explored the utility of two mathematical models in predicting glucose concentration levels in type 1 diabetic mice and determined disease pathways. We adapted two mathematical models, one with β-cells and the other with no β-cell component to determine their ca-pability in predicting glucose concentration and determine type 1 diabetes pathways using published glucose concentration data for four groups of experimental mice. The groups of mice were numbered Mice Group 1–4, depending on the diabetes severity of each group, with severity increasing from group 1–4. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo method based on a Bayesian framework was used to fit the model to determine the best model structure. Akaike information criteria (AIC) and Bayesian information criteria (BIC) approaches were used to assess the best model structure for type 1 diabetes. In fitting the model with no β-cells to glucose level data, we varied insulin absorption rate and insulin clearance rate. However, the model with β-cells required more parameters to match the data and we fitted the β-cell glucose tolerance factor, whole body insulin clearance rate, glucose production rate, and glucose clearance rate. Fitting the models to the blood glucose concentration level gave the least difference in AIC of 1.2, and a difference in BIC of 0.12 for Mice Group 4. The estimated AIC and BIC values were highest for Mice Group 1 than all other mice groups. The models gave substantial differences in AIC and BIC values for Mice Groups 1–3 ranging from 2.10 to 4.05. Our results suggest that the model without β-cells provides a more suitable structure for modelling type 1 diabetes and predicting blood glucose concentration for hypoglycaemic episodes."

This review aimed to assess to what extent COVID-19 clinical trials have considered the impact of race and ethnicity on COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy. Study design: This was a systematic review. Methods: Data regarding ethnicity in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials were systematically reviewed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines in this systematic review, which ran from inception until June 2021. Three international databases, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science, were used to conduct systematic article searches. Only two studies reported vaccine efficacy among ethnic minority groups. Results: The efficacy of the mRNA-1273 vaccine was confirmed to be 95% in Caucasians and 97.5% in ‘people of colour’ in a study by Baden et al. In another study by Polack et al., BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine efficacy was reported to be 95.2% in Caucasians, 100% in Afro-Caribbean or African Americans, 94.2% in Hispanic or Latinx and 95.4% in non-Hispanic, non-Latinx people. Conclusions: Given the highly differing effect of COVID-19 on the Afro-Caribbean, Hispanic and South Asian populations, it is imperative for COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials to thoroughly assess the safety and efficacy of vaccines in different ethnicities and, if necessary, develop ethnicity-specific protocols, which can minimise the disproportionate effect of COVID-19 on ethnic minority populations."

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading form of dementia worldwide. AD disrupts neuronal pathways and thus is commonly viewed as a network disorder. Many studies demonstrate the power of functional connectivity (FC) graph-based biomarkers for automated diagnosis of AD using electroencephalography (EEG). However, various FC measures are commonly utilised, as each aims to quantify a unique aspect of brain coupling. Graph neural networks (GNN) provide a powerful framework for learning on graphs. While a growing number of studies use GNN to classify EEG brain graphs, it is unclear which method should be utilised to estimate the brain graph. We use eight FC measures to estimate FC brain graphs from sensor-level EEG signals. GNN models are trained in order to compare the performance of the selected FC measures. Additionally, three baseline models based on literature are trained for comparison. We show that GNN models perform significantly better than the other baseline models. Moreover, using FC measures to estimate brain graphs improves the performance of GNN compared to models trained using a fixed graph based on the spatial distance between the EEG sensors. However, no FC measure performs consistently better than the other measures. The best GNN reaches 0.984 area under sensitivity-specificity curve (AUC) and 92% accuracy, whereas the best baseline model, a convolutional neural network, has 0.924 AUC and 84.7% accuracy."

      "abstract": "Purpose: Reducing X-ray dose increases safety in cardiac electrophysiology procedures but also increases image noise and artifacts which may affect the discernibility of devices and anatomical cues. Previous denoising methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown improvements in the quality of low-dose X-ray fluoroscopy images but may compromise clinically important details required by cardiologists. Methods: In order to obtain denoised X-ray fluoroscopy images whilst preserving details, we propose a novel deep-learning-based denoising framework, namely edge-enhancement densenet (EEDN), in which an attention-awareness edge-enhancement module is designed to increase edge sharpness. In this framework, a CNN-based denoiser is first used to generate an initial denoising result. Contours representing edge information are then extracted using an attention block and a group of interacted ultra-dense blocks for edge feature representation. Finally, the initial denoising result and enhanced edges are combined to generate the final X-ray image. The proposed denoising framework was tested on a total of 3262 clinical images taken from 100 low-dose X-ray sequences acquired from 20 patients. The performance was assessed by pairwise voting from five cardiologists as well as quantitative indicators. Furthermore, we evaluated our technique's effect on catheter detection using 416 images containing coronary sinus catheters in order to examine its influence as a pre-processing tool. Results: The average signal-to-noise ratio of X-ray images denoised with EEDN was 24.5, which was 2.2 times higher than that of the original images. The accuracy of catheter detection from EEDN denoised sequences showed no significant difference compared with their original counterparts. Moreover, EEDN received the highest average votes in our clinician assessment when compared to our existing technique and the original images. Conclusion: The proposed deep learning-based framework shows promising capability for denoising interventional X-ray fluoroscopy images. The results from the catheter detection show that the network does not affect the results of such an algorithm when used as a pre-processing step. The extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations suggest that the network may be of benefit to reduce radiation dose when applied in real time in the catheter laboratory."

      "abstract": "We propose a differential radial basis function (RBF) network termed RBF-DiffNet—whose hidden layer blocks are partial differential equations (PDEs) linear in terms of the RBF—to make the baseline RBF network robust to noise in sequential data. Assuming that the sequential data derives from the discretisation of the solution to an underlying PDE, the differential RBF network learns constant linear coefficients of the PDE, consequently regularising the RBF network by following modified backward-Euler updates. We experimentally validate the differential RBF network on the logistic map chaotic timeseries as well as on 30 real-world timeseries provided by Walmart in the M5 forecasting competition. The proposed model is compared with the normalised and unnormalised RBF networks, ARIMA, and ensembles of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and recurrent networks with long short-term memory (LSTM) blocks. From the experimental results, RBF-DiffNet consistently shows a marked reduction in the prediction error over the baseline RBF network (e.g., 41% reduction in the root mean squared scaled error on the M5 dataset, and 53% reduction in the mean absolute error on the logistic map); RBF-DiffNet also shows a comparable performance to the LSTM ensemble but requires 99% less computational time. Our proposed network consequently enables more accurate predictions—in the presence of observational noise—in sequence modelling tasks such as timeseries forecasting that leverage the model interpretability, fast training, and function approximation properties of the RBF network."

      "abstract": "Sleep apnea (SA) is a common sleep disorder that is not easy to detect. Recent studies have highlighted ECG analysis as an effective method of diagnosing SA. Because the changes caused by SA on the ECG are imperceptible, the need for new methods in diagnosing this disease is required more than ever. Machine Learning (ML) is recognized as one of the most successful methods of computer aided diagnosis. ML uses new methods to diagnose diseases using past clinical results. The purpose of this study is to evaluate studies using ML algorithms based on ECG characteristics to assess people suffering from SA. In this study, systematically-reviewed articles written in English before October 2020 and indexed in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE databases were searched with no lower time limit. From these articles, 48 were selected for further review. The selected articles adopteddifferent ML methods for classification. All of these studies were binary where SA was detected from the normal state based on a full ECG stripe (per record), or based on one-minute segments (per segment). Our analysis show that the most common features used in the studies were frequency, time series, and statistical features. Support-Vector Machine (SVM) and deep learning-based neural network (i.e. CNN, DNN) performed best in full record data detection. The highest accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity reported among the selected studies were 100%, which was obtained by an SVM. In another study, the classification was conducted based on ECG segments, and accordingly, the highest classification accuracy was observed in the residual neural network algorithm (RNN). The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of this algorithm were reported to be 99%. In general, it can be stated that ML techniques based on ECG characteristics have a high capability in diagnosing SA. These techniques can increase the diagnosis of patients with SA or the detection of SA episodes on ECG record, and can potentially prevent complications of the disease at later stages."

To facilitate the proper design of these genetic feedback control circuits, an accurate model that is able to capture the vital dynamical behaviour of the pathogen-infected plant is required. In this study, using a data-driven modelling approach, we develop and compare four dynamical models (i.e. linear, Michaelis-Menten with Hill coefficient (Hill Function), standard S-System and extended S-System) of a pathogen-infected plant gene regulatory network (GRN). These models are then assessed across several criteria, i.e. ease of identifying the type of gene regulation, the predictive capability, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the robustness to parameter uncertainty to determine its viability of balancing between biological complexity and accuracy when modelling the pathogen-infected plant GRN. Using our defined ranking score, we obtain the following insights to the modelling of GRN. Our analyses show that despite commonly used and provide biological relevance, the Hill Function model ranks the lowest while the extended S-System model ranks highest in the overall comparison. Interestingly, the performance of the linear model is more consistent throughout the comparison, making it the preferred model for this pathogen-infected plant GRN when considering data-driven modelling approach."

      "abstract": "Citation function classification is an important task in scientific text mining. The past two decades have witnessed many computerised algorithms working on various citation function datasets tailored to various annotation schemes. Recently, deep learning has pushed the state of the art by a large margin. Several pitfalls exist. Due to annotation difficulty, data sizes, especially the minority classes, are often not big enough for training effective deep learning models. Being less discussed, most state-of-the-art deep learning solutions in fact generate a feature representation for the citation sentence or context, instead of modelling individual in-text citations. This is conceptually flawed as it is common to see multiple in-text citations with different functions in the same citation sentence. In addition, existing deep learning studies have only explored a rather limited design space of encoding citation and its surrounding context. This paper explored a wide range of modelling options based on SciBERT, the popular cross-disciplinary pre-trained scientific language model, and their performances on citation function classification, for the purpose of determining the most effective way of modeling citation and its context. To deal with the data size issue, we created a large-scale citation function dataset by mapping, merging and re-annotating six publicly available datasets from the computational linguistics domain by adapting Teufel et al.'s 12-class scheme. The best F1 scores we achieved were around 66.16%, 71.39% and 73.56% on a 11-class annotation scheme slightly adapted from Teufel et al.'s 12-class scheme, a reduced 7-class scheme by merging comparison functions, and Jurgens et al.'s 6-class scheme respectively. A useful observation is that there is no single best model that is superior for all functions, therefore the trained model variants allow for applications which emphasise on a specific type of or a specific group of citation functions."

The comparative graph is constructed using sentences as nodes and three different relationships of sentences\nas edges.

Experiments show that CGSUM outperforms\ncomparative baselines on CSSC and performs well on DUC2006 and DUC2007."

Accessible and non-invasive methods of diagnosing and characterising AD are therefore urgently required. Electroencephalography (EEG) fulfils these criteria and is often used when studying AD. Several features derived from EEG were shown to predict AD with high accuracy, e.g. signal complexity and synchronisation. However, the dynamics of how the brain transitions between stable states have not been properly studied in the case of AD and EEG. Energy landscape analysis is a method that can be used to quantify these dynamics. This work presents the first application of this method to both AD and EEG. Energy landscape assigns energy value to each possible state, i.e. pattern of activations across brain regions. The energy is inversely proportional to the probability of occurrence. By studying the features of energy landscapes of 20 AD patients and 20 age-matched healthy counterparts (HC), significant differences are found. The dynamics of AD patients' EEG are shown to be more constrained - with more local minima, less variation in basin size, and smaller basins. We show that energy landscapes can predict AD with high accuracy, performing significantly better than baseline models. Moreover, these findings are replicated in a separate dataset including 9 AD and 10 HC above 70 years old."

Overlaying “historic” data (potentially generated before the calls) with “targeted” surveys (usually generated after the calls) may enable an assessment of possible network changes, or whether additional cells may also have served at a given location at a previous time.

      "abstract": "Brain tumors are a pernicious cancer with one of the lowest five-year survival rates. Neurologists often use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose the type of brain tumor. Automated computer-assisted tools can help them speed up the diagnosis process and reduce the burden on the health care systems. Recent advances in deep learning for medical imaging have shown remarkable results, especially in the automatic and instant diagnosis of various cancers. However, we need a large amount of data (images) to train the deep learning models in order to obtain good results. Large public datasets are rare in medicine. This paper proposes a framework based on unsupervised deep generative neural networks to solve this limitation. We combine two generative models in the proposed framework: Variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs). We swap the encoder–decoder network after initially training it on the training set of available MR images. The output of this swapped network is a noise vector that has information of the image manifold, and the cascaded generative adversarial network samples the input from this informative noise vector instead of random Gaussian noise. The proposed method helps the GAN to avoid mode collapse and generate realistic-looking brain tumor magnetic resonance images. These artificially generated images could solve the limitation of small medical datasets up to a reasonable extent and help the deep learning models perform acceptably. We used the ResNet50 as a classifier, and the artificially generated brain tumor images are used to augment the real and available images during the classifier training. We compared the classification results with several existing studies and state-of-the-art machine learning models. Our proposed methodology noticeably achieved better results. By using brain tumor images generated artificially by our proposed method, the classification average accuracy improved from 72.63% to 96.25%. For the most severe class of brain tumor, glioma, we achieved 0.769, 0.837, 0.833, and 0.80 values for recall, specificity, precision, and F1-score, respectively. The proposed generative model framework could be used to generate medical images in any domain, including PET (positron emission tomography) and MRI scans of various parts of the body, and the results show that it could be a useful clinical tool for medical experts."

Linear FC measures have been applied to study the differences in AD by splitting neurophysiological signals such as electroencephalography (EEG) recordings into discrete frequency\nbands and analysing them in isolation. We address this limitation by quantifying cross-frequency FC in addition to the traditional within-band approach. Cross-bispectrum, a higher-order spectral analysis, is used to measure the nonlinear FC and is compared with the cross-spectrum, which only measures the linear FC within bands. Each frequency coupling is then used to construct an FC network, which is in turn vectorised and used to train a classifier. We show that fusing features from networks improves classification accuracy. Although both within-frequency and cross-frequency networks can be used to predict AD with high accuracy, our results show that bispectrum-based FC outperforms cross-spectrum suggesting an important role of cross-frequency FC."

      "abstract": "Due to the dynamic nature of the food supply chain system, food supply management could suffer because of, and be interrupted by, unforeseen events. Considering the perishable nature of fresh food products and their short life cycle, fresh food companies feel immense pressure to adopt an efficient and proactive risk management system. The risk management aspects within the food supply chains have been addressed in several studies. However, only a few studies focus on the complex interactions between the various types of risks impacting food supply chain functionality and dynamic feedback effects, which can generate a reliable risk management system. This paper strives to contribute to this evident research gap by adopting a system dynamics modelling approach to generate a systemic risk management model. The system dynamics model serves as the basis for the simulation of risk index values and can be explored in future work to further analyse the dynamic risk’s effect on the food supply chain system’s behaviour. According to a literature review of published research from 2017 to 2021, nine different risks across the food supply chain were identified as a subsection of the major risk categories: macro-level and operational risks. Following this stage, two of the risk groups identified first were integrated with a developed system dynamics model to conduct this research and to evaluate the interaction between the risks and the functionality of the three main dairy supply chain processes: production, logistics, and retailing. The key findings drawn from this paper can be beneficial for enhancing managerial discernment regarding the critical role of system dynamics models for analysing various types of risks across the food supply chain process and improving its efficiency."

As a result, moving to Level-4 and Level-5 autonomy in the near future is starting to look like a certain possibility. Use of AI in vehicles and, in particular, cutting-edge computer vision, signal processing and control techniques have contributed significantly to the high-tech nature of state-of-the-art Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) available in cars today. In modern automobiles, AI not only contributes substantially to systems such as ADAS, but also in the areas of vehicles’ connectivity, automotive cybersecurity, and smart road infrastructure development. The next generation driverless vehicles will be completely reliant on these technologies to transport passengers and goods from one place to other, whilst eliminating human intervention entirely. However, despite the many advancements in AI for connected and autonomous vehicles done so far, there are several issues that are responsible of holding back the wide-scale deployment of AI based autonomous vehicles on roads, which are discussed in this editorial paper. Until and unless these critical issues are addressed, it would be difficult to indicate an accurate future moment in time when autonomous vehicles will become a reality globally."

      "abstract": "Handling missing values and large-dimensional features are crucial requirements for data-driven fault diagnosis systems. However, most intelligent data-driven diagnostic systems are not able to handle missing data. The presence of high-dimensional feature sets can also further complicate the process of fault diagnosis. This paper aims to devise a missing data imputation unit along with a dimensionality reduction unit in the pre-processing module of the diagnostic system. This paper proposes a novel pooling strategy for missing data imputation (PSMI). This strategy can simplify complex patterns of missingness and incrementally update the pool. The pre-processing module receives incomplete observations, PSMI estimates missing values, and, then, the dimensionality reduction unit transforms completed observations onto a lower-dimensional feature space. These transformed observations are then fed as inputs to the fault classification module for decision making and diagnosis. This diagnostic scheme makes use of various state-of-the-art missing data imputation, dimensionality reduction and classification algorithms. This enables a comprehensive comparison and allows to find the best techniques for the sake of diagnosing faults in the Tennessee Eastman process. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed pooling strategy and indicate that principal component analysis imputation and heteroscedastic discriminant analysis approaches outperform other imputation and dimensionality reduction techniques in this diagnostic application."

In this algorithm, the Gaussian distribution is employed to generate the sequence of random numbers in the QPSO algorithm. By decreasing the variance of the Gaussian distribution linearly, the algorithm is able not only to maintain its global search ability during the early search stages, but can also obtain gradually enhanced local search ability in the later search stages. Additionally, a weighted mean best position in the IG-QPSO is employed to achieve a good balance between local search and global search. The proposed algorithm and some other well-known PSO variants are tested on ten standard benchmark functions and six well-studied engineering shape design problems. Experimental results show that the IG-QPSO algorithm can optimize these problems effectively in terms of precision and robustness compared to its competitors."

However, most of the optimization search algorithms used in popular docking software are far from being ideal in the first case, and they can hardly be directly utilized for the latter case due to the relatively large search area. In order to design an algorithm that can flexibly adapt to different sizes of the search area, we propose an effective swarm intelligence optimization algorithm in this paper, called diversity-controlled Lamarckian quantum particle swarm optimization (DCL-QPSO). The highlights of the algorithm are a diversity-controlled strategy and a modified local search method. Integrated with the docking environment of Autodock, the DCL-QPSO is compared with Autodock Vina, Glide and other two Autodock-based search algorithms for flexible ligand docking. Experimental results revealed that the proposed algorithm has a performance comparable to those of Autodock Vina and Glide for dockings within a certain area around the binding sites, and is a more effective solver than all the compared methods for dockings without prior knowledge of the binding sites."

      "abstract": "The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a well studied logistical problem along with its various variants such as VRP with customer Time-Window (VRPTW). However, all the previously studied variants assume that vehicles are mostly the same in terms of their capacity, location and home location (depot). This study uses the agent-based approach for solving VRPTW with vehicle's unique location and depot. This is to minimise the number of used vehicles as the main target. Other targets including total distance travelled, waiting time and time are also considered as criteria to evaluate the quality of the generated vehicle routes. This is achieved by proposing a Messaging Protocol-based Heuristics Optimisation (MPHO) model that balances between centrally-distributed agents' interactions and accommodates certain priority rules specifically developed for the problem. Furthermore, modifications to certain constraints checking techniques are introduced by implementing time Push Forward (PF) checking recursively tailored to the route's unique start/ending locations as well as calculating the reduced waiting time to find and check the limit of the total route duration. In order to justify the superiority of the proposed MPHO model, numerical tests have been conducted on benchmark problems including single and multiple depot instances as well as modified instances tailored to the problem. This is made possible by randomising vehicles' capacities and their unique locations and depots. Key results reveal that, in multiple depot instances, higher quality solutions compared with previous benchmark outcomes are obtained in terms of minimising the total number of vehicles along with fastest solution time (CPU) at the expense of total time and distance travelled."

The early detection of cervical cancer is done relatively by using the Pap Smear cell Test. This method of detection is challenged by the degradation phenomenon within the image segmentation task that arises when the superpixel count is minimized. This paper introduces a Hybrid Linear Iterative Clustering and Bayes classification-based GrabCut Segmentation Technique (HLC-BC-GCST) for the dynamic detection of Cervical cancer. In this proposed HLC-BC-GCST approach, the Linear Iterative Clustering process is employed to cluster the potential features of the preprocessed image, which is then combined with GrabCut to prevent the issues that arise when the number of superpixels is minimized. In addition, the proposed HLC-BC-GCST scheme benefits of the advantages of the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) on the extracted features from the iterative clustering method, based on which the mapping is performed to describe the energy function. Then, Bayes classification is used for reconstructing the graph cut model from the extracted energy function derived from the GMM model-based Linear Iterative Clustering features for better computation and implementation. Finally, the boundary optimization method is utilized to considerably minimize the roughness of cervical cells, which contains the cytoplasm and nuclei regions, using the GrabCut algorithm to facilitate improved segmentation accuracy. The results of the proposed HLC-BC-GCST scheme are 6% better than the results obtained by other standard detection approaches of cervical cancer using graph cuts."

      "abstract": "Self-driving vehicles need a robust positioning system to continue the revolution in intelligent transportation. Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are most commonly used to accomplish this task because of their ability to accurately locate the vehicle in the environment. However, recent publications have revealed serious cases where GNSS fails miserably to determine the position of the vehicle, for example, under a bridge, in a tunnel, or in dense forests. In this work, we propose a framework architecture of explaining deep learning LiDAR-based (XDLL) models that predicts the position of the vehicles by using only a few LiDAR points in the environment, which ensures the required fastness and accuracy of interactions between vehicle components. The proposed framework extracts non-semantic features from LiDAR scans using a clustering algorithm. The identified clusters serve as input to our deep learning model, which relies on LSTM and GRU layers to store the trajectory points and convolutional layers to smooth the data. The model has been extensively tested with short- and long-term trajectories from two benchmark datasets, Kitti and NCLT, containing different environmental scenarios. Moreover, we investigated the obtained results by explaining the contribution of each cluster feature by using several explainable methods, including Saliency, SmoothGrad, and VarGrad. The analysis showed that taking the mean of all the clusters as an input for the model is enough to obtain better accuracy compared to the first model, and it reduces the time consumption as well. The improved model is able to obtain a mean absolute positioning error of below one meter for all sequences in the short- and long-term trajectories."

      "abstract": "The automatic recognition and classification of infected plant leaves play an important role in precision agriculture and in helping to improve crop yields. With the advancements in the fields of artificial intelligence and computer vision, an exponential progress has been observed in their applications to agriculture, such as in plant leaf disease detection and subsequent decision making. However, the complexity and diversity in the structural background of plant leaf images pose several challenges. This article introduces a novel bag-of-features algorithm, called <italic>Upgraded Slime mould Algorithm-Bag of Features (USMA-BOF)</italic>, for an effective classification of plant leaf images. The stochastic-based upgraded USMA is proposed to determine the optimal visual words. Further, the occurrence or repetition of optimal visual features is represented through a new discrete dual complex chirplet transform (DDCCT) method. Finally, the classification is performed using two classifiers: a support vector machine (SVM) and a multilayer perceptron (MLP). The performance of USMA is first compared with state-of-the-art algorithms on IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) 2017 benchmark functions. Then, the proposed USMA-BOF algorithm is applied on a classification dataset with binary outputs for disease identification in sustainable agriculture. The MLP classifier performs better than SVM, with an average accuracy of 0.7552 using the proposed USMA-BOF algorithm, as compared to 0.7262, 0.6989, 0.6343, and 0.7262 using the algorithms whale optimization algorithm (WOA)-BOF, adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO)-BOF, gray wolf optimization (GWO)-BOF, and SMA-BOF, respectively."

We show that by increasing the migration rate, there are more bifurcation sequences than previous works showed. In particular, the number of steady states can change from 9 (small migration) to 3 (large migration) at a single bifurcation point, or via a sequence of bifurcations with the system having 9, 7, 5, 3 steady states or 9, 7, 9, 3 steady states, depending on the Allee threshold. This is in contrast with the case of bidirectional migration, where the number of steady states always goes through the same bifurcation sequence of 9, 5, 3 steady states as we increase the migration rate, regardless of the value of the Allee threshold. These results have practical implications as well in spatial ecology."

Its slow and heterogeneous progression over time makes timely diagnosis challenging. Wrist-worn digital devices, particularly smartwatches, are currently the most popular tools in the PD research field due to their convenience for long-term daily life monitoring. While wrist-worn sensing devices have garnered significant interest, their value for daily practice is still unclear. In this narrative review, we survey demographic, clinical and technological information from 39 articles across four public databases. Wrist-worn technology mainly monitors motor symptoms and sleep disorders of patients in daily life. We find that accelerometers are the most commonly used sensors to measure the movement of people living with PD. There are few studies on monitoring the disease progression compared to symptom classification. We conclude that wrist-worn sensing technology might be useful to assist in the management of PD through an automatic assessment based on patient-provided daily living information."

The emerging field of graph signal processing (GSP) promises to analyse dynamic characteristics of multivariate signals, while at the same time taking the network, or spatial structure between the signals into account. To do so, GSP decomposes the multivariate signals into graph frequency signals, which are ordered by their magnitude. However, the meaning of the graph frequencies in terms of this ordering remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role the ordering plays in preserving valuable dynamic structures in the signals, with neuroimaging applications in mind. In order to overcome the limitations in sample size common to neurophysiological data sets, we introduce a minimalist simulation framework to generate arbitrary amounts of data. Using this artificial data, we find that lower graph frequency signals are less suitable for classifying neurophysiological data than higher graph frequency signals. We further introduce a baseline testing framework for GSP. Using this framework, we conclude that dynamic, or spectral structures are poorly preserved in GSP, high-lighting current limitations of GSP for neuroimaging."

By considering stochas- tic noise in the turbulence and zonal flows as well as constant and time-varying input power Q, we perform multiple stochastic simulations of over a million trajectories using GPU computing. Due to stochastic noise, some trajectories undergo the L-H transition while others do not, leading to a mixture of H-mode and dithering at a given time and/or input power. One of the consequences of this is that H-mode characteristics appear at a smaller input power Q < Qc (where Qc is the critical value for the L-H transition in the deterministic system) as a secondary peak of a probability density function (PDF) while dithering characteristics persists beyond the power threshold for Q > Qc as a second peak. The coexisting H-mode and dithering near Q = Qc leads to a prominent bimodal PDF with a gradual L-H transition rather than a sudden transition at Q = Qc and uncertainty in the input power. Also, a time-dependent input power leads to increased variability (dispersion) in stochastic trajectories and a more prominent bimodal PDF. We provide an interpretation of the results using information geometry to elucidate self-regulation between zonal flows, turbulence, and information causality rate to unravel causal relations involved in the L-H transition."

      "abstract": "This article presents a postprocessing-based spectral-spatial classification (SSC) approach for hyperspectral (HS) images. The approach effectively overcomes the limitations of traditional pixel-based classifiers by integrating spectral and spatial information to achieve improved classification results. Specifically, the proposed method uses principal component analysis to transform the HS images and the Naive Bayes (NB) classifier to quickly derive spectral-posterior probabilities. Spatial-posterior probabilities are then computed using an adaptive fast Fourier transform (AFFT) and a probabilistic closeness function. These probabilities are then combined to generate a precise SSC map. The proposed approach is available in two distinct styles: the conventional NB-AFFT-SSC method and the proposed iterationwise variable sequencing based NB-AFFT-SSC (IVS-NB-AFFT-SSC) method, which classifies one designated class in each iteration. In addition, two wrapper-based feature selection methods are proposed to obtain a set of principal components (PCs) for each class of the HS image, significantly improving classification accuracy. The approach's efficacy is demonstrated through extensive experimentation on three real HS datasets, including Washington DC Mall, Salinas-A, and Botswana. The generality of the approach has been proven through the use of other well-known machine-learning algorithms, such as support vector machine and K-nearest neighbor, as wrappers in the approach. The results confirm that the proposed approach is highly effective, with the IVS approach helping users concentrate on a particular set of PCs for the class of interest."

The benchmarking also brings forward some interesting debate on the use/inclusion of rational functions and algebraic numbers in the SMT-LIB."

      "abstract": "The quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm, a variant of particle swarm optimization (PSO), has been proven to be an effective tool to solve various of optimization problems. However, like other PSO variants, it often suffers a premature convergence, especially when solving complex optimization problems. Considering this issue, this paper proposes a hybrid QPSO with dynamic grouping searching strategy, named QPSO-DGS. During the search process, the particle swarm is dynamically grouped into two subpopulations, which are assigned to implement the exploration and exploitation search, respectively. In each subpopulation, a comprehensive learning strategy is used for each particle to adjust its personal best position with a certain probability. Besides, a modified opposition-based computation is employed to improve the swarm diversity. The experimental comparison is conducted between the QPSO-DGS and other seven state-of-art PSO variants on the CEC’2013 test suit. The experimental results show that QPSO-DGS has a promising performance in terms of the solution accuracy and the convergence speed on the majority of these test functions, and especially on multimodal problems."

      "abstract": "3D human models accurately represent the shape of the subjects, which is key to many human-centric industrial applications, including fashion design, body biometrics extraction, and computer animation. These tasks usually require a high-fidelity human body mesh in a canonical posture (e.g., &#x2018;A&#x2019; pose or &#x2018;T&#x2019; pose). Although 3D scanning technology is fast and popular for acquiring the subject&#x0027;s body shape, automatically normalizing the posture of scanned bodies is still under-researched. Existing methods highly rely on skeleton-driven animation technologies. However, these methods require carefully-designed skeleton and skin weights, which is time-consuming and fails when the initial posture is complicated. In this work, a novel deep learning-based approach, dubbed PoseNormNet, is proposed to automatically normalize the postures of scanned bodies. The proposed algorithm provides strong operability since it does not require any rigging priors and works well for subjects in arbitrary postures. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both objective and subjective terms."

Traditional body volume estimation techniques such as underwater weighing and air displacement demand a lot of equipment, and are difficult to be performed under some circumstances, e.g. in clinical environments when dealing with bedridden patients. In this contribution, a novel vision-based method dubbed Point2PartVolume based on deep learning is proposed to rapidly and accurately predict the part-aware body volumes from a single depth image of the dressed body. Firstly, a novel multi-task neural network is proposed for jointly completing the partial body point clouds, predicting the body shape under clothing, and semantically segmenting the reconstructed body into parts. Next, the estimated body segments are fed into the proposed volume regression network to estimate the partial volumes. A simple yet efficient two-step training strategy is proposed for improving the accuracy of volume prediction regressed from point clouds. Compared to existing methods, the proposed method addresses several major challenges in vision-based human body volume estimation, including shape completion, pose estimation, body shape estimation under clothing, body segmentation, and volume regression from point clouds. Experimental results on both the synthetic data and public real-world data show our method achieved average 90% volume prediction accuracy and outperformed the relevant state-of-the-art."

      "abstract": "Controlled environment farming has become an attractive solution to increase the food production with limited use of resources. LED lights are often used in this type of farming to increase plant yield. LED lights are dc load, whereas the grid provides ac power. This necessitates the use of power factor correction (PFC) converter as an interface between the grid and the lights. This paper proposes an innovative control method for the boost PFC converter, where an advanced phase-locked loop scheme is developed that can eliminate measurement dc offset and provide harmonic robust estimation of the grid voltage fundamental component. The applied nonlinear control uses the existing two-loop control architecture. Based on a baseline PI controller, a nonlinear function is added to make the controller react faster when it is far from the reference and vice-versa. Comprehensive simulation studies are conducted to assess the performance of the proposed method under various challenging test scenarios. Compared to the baseline method, the proposed technique achieved 42%∼65% reduction in total harmonic distortion depending on the test cases, which makes the technique a suitable candidate for improving the operational efficiency and, consequently, the running cost of a smart farming lighting system on an industrial scale. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed method over the conventional counterpart."

      "abstract": "Modelling the hydro-morphodynamics of mangrove environments is key for implementing successful protection and restoration projects in a climatically vulnerable region. Nevertheless, simulation of such dynamics is faced with computational and time constraints, given the nonlinear and complex nature of the problem, which could become a bottleneck for large-scale applications. The recent advances in machine learning, specifically, in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), have gained much attention due to the potential to provide fast and accurate results, while preserving the binding physics laws and requiring small amounts of data in contrast to other neural networks. In this sense, such networks encode the physics equations into the neural network, and the latter must fit the noisy observed data whilst minimising the equation residual. This study investigates the application of PINNs to quantify the capacity of mangrove environments to attenuate waves and prevent erosion, and represents the first application of PINNs to model vegetation for a large-scale geographical domain with complex boundary conditions. Navier–Stokes, the broadly used mathematical equation to solve for fluid dynamics, is used as the governing equation that constrains the neural network to respect the conservation of mass, energy, and momentum. The Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest in the world located between India and Bangladesh, is taken as a case study. The results demonstrate that the developed model is superior when compared to a numerical finite element model, in terms of time and data efficiency, yet produces equally strong overall results."

      "abstract": "Accurately reconstructing 3-D hand shapes of patients is important for immobilization device customization, artificial limb generation, and hand disease diagnosis. Traditional 3-D hand scanning requires multiple scans taken around the hand with a 3-D scanning device. These methods require the patients to keep an open-palm posture during scanning, which is painful or even impossible for patients with impaired hand functions. Once multi-view partial point clouds are collected, expensive post-processing is necessary to generate a high-fidelity hand shape. To address these limitations, we propose a novel deep-learning method dubbed PatientHandNet to reconstruct high-fidelity hand shapes in a canonical open-palm pose from multiple-depth images acquired with a single-depth camera. The hand poses in the depth images may vary, hand movements are allowed, facilitating the 3-D scanning process in particular for patients with difficult conditions. The proposed method has strong operability since it is insensitive to the input pose, allowing for pose variations in the input depth images. We also proposed two novel datasets: a large-scale synthetic dataset to train our model and a real-world dataset with ground-truth hand biometrics extracted by an experienced anthropometrist. Extensive experimental results on the unseen synthetic data and real-world data demonstrate that the proposed method provides robust and easy-to-use hand shape reconstruction and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in biometric accuracy terms."

      "abstract": "When implementing SVMs, two major problems are encountered: (a) the number of local minima of dual-SVM increases exponentially with the number of samples and (b) the computer storage memory required for a regular quadratic programming solver increases exponentially as the problem size expands. The Kernel-Adatron family of algorithms, gaining attention recently, has allowed us to handle very large classification and regression problems. However, these methods treat different types of samples (i.e., noise, border, and core) in the same manner, which makes these algorithms search in unpromising areas and increases the number of iterations as well. This paper introduces a hybrid method to overcome such shortcomings, called the Optimal Recurrent Neural Network and Density-Based Support Vector Machine (Opt-RNN-DBSVM). This method consists of four steps: (a) the characterization of different samples, (b) the elimination of samples with a low probability of being a support vector, (c) the construction of an appropriate recurrent neural network to solve the dual-DBSVM based on an original energy function, and (d) finding the solution to the system of differential equations that govern the dynamics of the RNN, using the Euler–Cauchy method involving an optimal time step. Density-based preprocessing reduces the number of local minima in the dual-SVM. The RNN’s recurring architecture avoids the need to explore recently visited areas. With the optimal time step, the search moves from the current vectors to the best neighboring support vectors. It is demonstrated that RNN-SVM converges to feasible support vectors and Opt-RNN-DBSVM has very low time complexity compared to the RNN-SVM with a constant time step and the Kernel-Adatron algorithm–SVM. Several classification performance measures are used to compare Opt-RNN-DBSVM with different classification methods and the results obtained show the good performance of the proposed method."

      "abstract": "Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a kernel-based learning model, which unfortunately suffers from computational intractability for irregular domain and large datasets due to the full kernel matrix. In this paper, we propose a novel method to produce a sparse kernel matrix using the compact support radial kernels (CSRKs) to efficiently learn the GPR from large datasets. The CSRKs can effectively avoid the ill-conditioned and full kernel matrix during GPR training and prediction, consequently reducing computational costs and memory requirements. In practice, the interest in CSRKs waned slightly as it became evident that, there is a trade-off principle (conflict between accuracy and sparsity) for compactly supported kernels. Hence, when using kernels with compact support, during GPR training, the main focus will be on providing a high level of accuracy. In this case, the advantage of achieving a sparse covariance matrix for CSRKs will almost disappear, as we will see in the numerical results. This trade-off has led authors to search for an “optimal” value of the scale parameter. Accordingly, by selecting the suitable priors on the kernel hyperparameters, and simply estimating the hyperparameters using a modified version of the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), the GPR model derived from the CSRKs yields maximal accuracy while still maintaining a sparse covariance matrix. In fact, in GPR training, modified version of the MLE will be proportional to the product of MLE and a given suitable prior distribution for the hyperparameters that provides an efficient method for learning. The misspecification of prior distributions and their impact on the predictability of the sparse GPR models are also comprehensively investigated using several empirical studies. The proposed new approach is applied to some irregular domains with noisy test functions in 2D data sets in a comparative study. We finally investigate the effect of prior on the predictability of GPR models based on the real dataset. The derived results suggest the proposed method leads to more sparsity and well-conditioned kernel matrices in all cases."

Compartment-based mathematical control models for diabetes usually result in objective functions whose terms are conflicting, preventing the use of single-objective-based models for obtaining appropriate personalized strategies. Taking into account the conflicting aspects when controlling the diabetic population dynamics, this paper introduces a multi-objective approach consisting of four steps: (a) modeling the problem of controlling the diabetic population dynamics using a multi-objective mathematical model, (b) discretizing the model using the trapezoidal rule and the Euler–Cauchy method, (c) using swarm-intelligence-based optimizers to solve the model and (d) structuring the set of controls using soft clustering methods, known for their flexibility. In contrast to single-objective approaches, experimental results show that the multi-objective approach obtains appropriate personalized controls, where the control associated with the compartment of diabetics without complications is totally different from that associated with the compartment of diabetics with complications. Moreover, these controls enable a significant reduction in the number of diabetics with and without complications, and the multi-objective strategy saves up to 4% of the resources needed for the control of diabetes without complications and up to 18% of resources for the control of diabetes with complications."

      "abstract": "Inclusive citizen science is an emerging research topic that has been extensively studied in recent years. However, most of the previous studies focused on the development of theoretical models and practical strategies that scholars can employ to attract diverse populations to their citizen science (CS) projects. Their findings were mostly based on either conceptual ethical frameworks or empirical observations of the scholars after the completion of the specific CS project. Few studies collected socio-demographic and behavioral data of the active citizens involved in a CS project to analyze the diversity of citizens in CS. However, to the best of our knowledge, having reviewed numerous peer-reviewed papers, none of the previous studies attempted to use prospective citizen scientists’ traits to investigate intrinsic factors that may help increase the active engagement and diversity in CS. This paper presents a new inclusive citizen science engagement model based on quantitative analysis of surveys administered to 540 participants of the dedicated free informal education course ‘Your Right to Privacy Online’ (MOOC - a massive online open course) from eight countries in the EU funded project, CSI-COP (Citizen Scientists Investigating Cookies and App GDPR compliance). The surveys were filled out just after completing the training stage and before joining the project as active citizen scientists. Out of the 540 participants who completed the surveys analyzed in this study, only 170 (32%) individuals actively participated as citizen scientists in the project. Therefore, the study attempted to understand what characterizes these participants compared to those who decided to refrain from joining the project after the training stage. This study’s findings revealed several important relationships and predictors for becoming a citizen scientist based on the surveys analysis, such as age, gender, culture, education, Internet accessibility and apps usage, as well as the satisfaction with the MOOC, the mode of training and initial intentions for becoming a citizen scientist. These findings lead to the development of the empirical model for inclusive engagement in CS and enhance the understanding of the internal factors that influence individuals' intention and actual participation as citizen scientists. The devised model offers valuable insights for designing inclusive recruitment strategies, fostering positive learning experiences, addressing technological barriers, bridging the intention-engagement gap, and tailoring engagement strategies to accommodate ethnic and cultural diversity."

Unfortunately, its major drawback is its asymptotic behavior where the prior to posterior convergence in terms of the standard metrics (and also computed by Fréchet derivative) used as a local sensitivity measure is not appropriate. The constructed local sensitivity measures do not converge to zero, and even diverge for the most multidimensional classes of prior distributions. Restricting the classes of priors or using other (Formula presented.) -divergence metrics have been proposed as the ways to resolve this issue which were not successful. We overcome this issue, by proposing a new flexible class of metrics so-called credible metrics whose asymptotic behavior is far more promising and no restrictions are required to impose. Using these metrics, the stability of Bayesian inference to the structure of the prior distribution will be then investigated. Under appropriate condition, we present a uniform bound in a sense that a close credible metric a priori will give a close credible metric a posteriori. As a result, we do not get the sort of divergence based on other metrics. We finally show that the posterior predictive distributions are more stable and robust."

Vision-based methods have been previously proposed but are limited in their ability to only extract hand dimensions in a static and standardized posture (open-palm hand). However, dynamic hand measurements should be considered when designing these wearable products since the interaction between hands and products cannot be ignored. Unfortunately, none of the existing methods are designed for measuring dynamic hands. To address this problem, we propose a user-friendly and fast method dubbed Measure4DHand, which automatically extracts dynamic hand measurements from a sequence of depth images captured by a single depth camera. Firstly, the ten dimensions of the hand are defined. Secondly, a deep neural network is developed to predict landmark sequences for the ten dimensions from partial point cloud sequences. Finally, a method is designed to calculate dimension values from landmark sequences. A novel synthetic dataset consisting of 234K hands in various shapes and poses, along with their corresponding ground truth landmarks, is proposed for training the proposed methods. The experiment based on real-world data captured by a Kinect illustrates the evolution of the ten dimensions during hand movement, while the mean ranges of variation are also reported, providing valuable information for the hand wearable product design."

Functional connectivity (FC) between EEG channels is often used for channel selection and connectivity analysis [4, S, 6]. Ideally, in the case of selecting channels for dynamical and causal analysis, FC methods should be able to account for linear and nonlinear spatial and temporal interactions between EEG channels. In neuroscience, FC is quantified using different measures of (dis) similarity to assess the statistical dependence between two signals [5]. However, the interpretation of FC measures can differ significantly from one measure to another[5, 7]. In the early diagnosis of AD, [7] showed correlations among various (dis)similarity measures, and therefore these measures can be grouped. Thus, one from each is sufficient to extract information from the data [7]. Therefore, the development of a generic measure of (dis)similarity is important in FC analysis."

      "abstract": "Dynamical, causal, and cross-frequency coupling analysis using the electroencephalogram (EEG) has gained significant attention for diagnosing and characterizing neurological disorders. Selecting important EEG channels is crucial for reducing computational complexity in implementing these methods and improving classification accuracy. In neuroscience, measures of (dis) similarity between EEG channels are often used as functional connectivity (FC) features, and important channels are selected via feature selection. Developing a generic measure of (dis) similarity is important for FC analysis and channel selection. In this study, learning of (dis) similarity information within the EEG is achieved using kernel-based nonlinear manifold learning. The focus is on FC changes and, thereby, EEG channel selection. Isomap and Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (Isomap-GPLVM) are employed for this purpose. The resulting kernel (dis) similarity matrix is used as a novel measure of linear and nonlinear FC between EEG channels. The analysis of EEG from healthy controls (HC) and patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) are presented as a case study. Classification results are compared with other commonly used FC measures. Our analysis shows significant differences in FC between bipolar channels of the occipital region and other regions (i.e. parietal, centro-parietal, and fronto-central) between AD and HC groups. Furthermore, our results indicate that FC changes between channels along the fronto-parietal region and the rest of the EEG are important in diagnosing AD. Our results and its relation to functional networks are consistent with those obtained from previous studies using fMRI, resting-state fMRI and EEG."

      "abstract": "Keystroke dynamics is a soft biometric based on the assumption that humans always type in uniquely characteristic manners. Previous works mainly focus on analyzing the key press or release events. Unlike these methods, we explore a novel visual modality of keystroke dynamics for human identification using a single RGB-D sensor. In order to verify this idea, we create a dataset dubbed KD-MultiModal that contains 243.2K frames of RGB images and depth images, obtained by recording the video of hand typing with a single RGB-D sensor. The dataset comprises RGB-D image sequences of 20 subjects (10 males and 10 females) typing sentences and each subject types around 20 sentences. In the task, only the hand and keyboard region contributes to the person identification, so we also propose methods of extracting Regions of Interest (RoI) for each type of data. Unlike the data of the key press or release, our dataset not only captures the velocity of pressing and releasing different keys and the typing style of specific keys or combinations of keys but also contains rich information on the hand shape and posture. To verify the validity of our proposed data, we adopt deep neural networks to learn distinguishing features from different data representations, including RGB-KD-Net, D-KD-Net and RGBD-KD-Net. Simultaneously, the sequence of point clouds also can be obtained from depth images given the intrinsic parameters of the RGB-D sensor, so we also study the performance of human identification based on the point clouds. Extensive experimental results show that our idea works and the performance of the proposed method based on RGB-D images is the best, which achieved 99.44% accuracy based on the unseen real-world data. To inspire more researchers and facilitate relevant studies, the proposed dataset will be publicly accessible together with the publication of this paper."

The data provided by such technology can estimate the bioenergy source production rate and monitor deforestation. This work participates in the cause by contributing an aerial dataset and developing an intelligent tree-detection system usable for counting trees with the bioenergy potential. Low-altitude flying units have been vastly used for such a purpose due to their ability to capture high-quality data from distant locations. Despite these potentials, collected images that compose a dataset are often characterized by imbalanced distribution among classes. The class disproportion can affect the overall model performance, as it severely deprives key features of under-represented classes. This study proposes data-level approaches that adopt and extend prior sampling algorithms for object detection problems. The devised techniques try to reduce the number of redundant outputs obtained from sampling methods and reduce the iteration required to achieve the target imbalance ratio by employing a systematic flow. In such a process, the class distribution of an original dataset is used as a guideline for selecting candidates for subsequent processes. Our results show that the modified dataset can reduce the length of a training process shown by fewer iterations required to achieve the final metrics of its original dataset version and lower training losses in each iteration. Additionally, the modified dataset can improve the F-score (F1) and precision metric of object detection algorithm by up to 6%."

Nevertheless, simulating such dynamics is faced with computational and time complexities, given the nonlinear and complex nature of the problem, which could become a bottleneck for large-scale applications. This study investigates the effect of mangrove environments on the hydro-morphodynamics of its region. A depth-averaged model was built using a novel finite element model for simulating coastal models, within Thetis. The Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest in the world located between India and Bangladesh, is taken as a case study. The Sundarbans is regularly subjected to tropical cyclones, the impacts of which endanger the lives of the region’s four million people. This is a first-time application of a coupled hydro-morphodyamic model using discontinuous Galerkin finite element discretisation for modelling mangrove environments in a real-world application. A wetting drying scheme was implemented in the models in order to avoid numerical instabilities. The effect of mangrove environments is demonstrated ,by imposing a periodic tidal boundary, conditions using TPXO tidal solver, using experiments with and without mangroves. The model is validated against the results of another study on the same region and tidal gauge data. Mangrove environments are able to decrease water elevations and velocities by more than 97%, and prevent almost any sediment erosion when compared with the experiment with no mangroves."

Currently, high-dimensional transcriptome datasets are produced from high-throughput sequencing techniques, such as microarray and RNA-Seq. These techniques can capture the differences in the expression of thousands of genes at once. Through these wet-lab experiments, studying the interconnections among a large number of genes or TFs at a network level is challenging [4]. Therefore, one of the important topics in computational biology is the inference of GRNs from high-dimensional gene expression data through statistical and machine learning approaches [2]."

While methods to generate new data already exist, they are flawed in several ways which may lead to bias in machine learning models trained upon them. In this paper, we describe how to use the Risch Algorithm for symbolic integration to create a dataset of elementary integrable expressions. Further, we show that data generated this way alleviates some of the flaws found in earlier methods."

      "abstract": "Soft computing models based on fuzzy or probabilistic approaches provide decision system makers with the necessary capabilities to deal with imprecise and incomplete information. Hybrid systems based on different soft computing approaches with complementary qualities and principles have also become popular. On the one hand, fuzzy logic makes its decisions on the basis of the degree of membership but gives no information on the frequency of an event; on the other hand, the probability informs us of the frequency of the event but gives no information on the degree of membership to a set. In this work, we propose a new measure that implements both fuzzy and probabilistic notions (i.e., the degree of membership and the frequency) while exploiting the ability of the convolution operator to combine functions on continuous intervals. This measure evaluates both the degree of membership and the frequency of objects/events in the design of decision support systems. We show, using concrete examples, the drawbacks of fuzzy logic and probability-based approaches taken separately, and we then show how a fuzzy probabilistic convolution measure allows the correction of these drawbacks. Based on this measure, we introduce a new clustering method named Fuzzy-Probabilistic-Convolution-C-Means (FP-Conv-CM). Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), Probabilistic K-Means (PKM), and FP-Conv-CM were tested on multiple datasets and compared on the basis of two performance measures based on the Silhouette metric and the Dunn’s Index. FP-Conv-CM was shown to improve on both metrics. In addition, FCM, PKM, and FP-Conv-CM were used for multiple image compression tasks and were compared based on three performance measures: Mean Square Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Structural SImilarity Index (SSIM). The proposed FP-Conv-CM method shows improvements in all these three measures as well."

      "abstract": "Main path analysis is a popular method for extracting the scientific backbone from the citation network of a research domain. Existing approaches ignored the semantic relationships between the citing and cited publications, resulting in several adverse issues, in terms of coherence of main paths and coverage of significant studies. This paper advocated the semantic main path analysis approach to alleviate these issues based on citation function analysis. A wide variety of SciBERT-based deep learning models were designed for identifying citation functions. Semantic citation networks were built by either including important citations, e.g., extension, motivation, usage and similarity, or excluding incidental citations like background and future work. Semantic main path network was built by merging the top-K main paths extracted from various time slices of semantic citation network. In addition, this study proposed a three-way framework for quantitative evaluation of main path analysis results. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis on three research areas of computational linguistics demonstrated that, compared to semantics-agnostic counterparts, different types of semantic main path networks provide complementary views scientific knowledge flows. Combining them together, we can obtain a more precise and comprehensive picture of domain evolution and uncover more coherent development pathways between scientific ideas."

In this paper, a novel hybrid algorithm is proposed and applied in the docking environment of AutoDock version 4.2.6 in order to enhance the accuracy and the efficiency for dockings with flexible ligands. This search algorithm, called entropy-based Lamarckian quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (ELQPSO), is a combination of the QPSO with an entropy-based update strategy and the Solis and Wet local search (SWLS) method. By using the PDBbind core set v.2016, the ELQPSO is compared with the Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA), Lamarckian particle swarm optimization (LPSO) and Lamarckian QPSO (LQPSO). The experimental results reveal that the corresponding docking program of ELQPSO, named as EQDOCK in this paper, has a competitive performance in dealing with the protein-ligand docking problems. Moreover, for the test cases with different number of torsions, the EQDOCK outperforms the other three docking programs in finding docking conformations with small root mean squared deviation (RMSD) values in most cases. In particular, it has an advantage of solving highly flexible ligand docking problems over the others."

In recent years, there has been remarkable progress in the field of brain imaging techniques. Meanwhile, advancements in brain imaging technologies have greatly enhanced our understanding of brain networks. As an important tool for exploring the relationship between brain structure and function, brain network computation represents the most promising direction for artificial intelligence to achieve breakthroughs and advancements in the field of neuroscience. By employing artificial intelligence algorithms to integrate complementary features from multi-modal brain imaging, it is possible to uncover the connectivity characteristics of neural circuits and establish multi-level mapping brain network models based on function, structure, and organization.\n\nGenerative artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed significant expansion, encompassing the utilization of available data to generate fresh content that exhibits comparable underlying patterns to real-world data. The fusion of these two realms, generative AI and neuroimaging, offers a promising path for delving into diverse domains of brain imaging and brain network computation, specifically in the realms of extracting spatio-temporal brain characteristics and reconstructing the topological connectivity of brain networks. Generative artificial intelligence assists researchers in learning and understanding brain functional mechanisms in a broader feature space under limited sample conditions. It aids researchers in designing efficient fusion methods capable of handling and correlating multimodal data and domain knowledge information. By integrating multimodal brain data with prior knowledge from neuroscience, it achieves complementary synergy between the cooperative semantic information and knowledge rules inherent in different levels and factors of the brain."

Remote human activity recognition (HAR) is beneficial for regular monitoring of the elderly population. This paper addresses the problem of the continuous detection of daily human activities using a mm-wave Doppler radar. In this study, two strategies have been employed: the first method uses un-equalized series of activities, whereas the second method utilizes a gradient-based strategy for equalization of the series of activities. The dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm and Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) techniques have been implemented for the classification of un-equalized and equalized series of activities, respectively. The input for DTW was provided using three strategies. The first approach uses the pixel-level data of frames (UnSup-PLevel). In the other two strategies, a convolutional variational autoencoder (CVAE) is used to extract Un-Supervised Encoded features (UnSup-EnLevel) and Supervised Encoded features (Sup-EnLevel) from the series of Doppler frames. The second approach for equalized data series involves the application of four distinct feature extraction methods: i.e., convolutional neural networks (CNN), supervised and unsupervised CVAE, and principal component Analysis (PCA). The extracted features were considered as an input to the LSTM. This paper presents a comparative analysis of a novel supervised feature extraction pipeline, employing Sup-ENLevel-DTW and Sup-EnLevel-LSTM, against several state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, including UnSUp-EnLevel-DTW, UnSup-EnLevel-LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and PCA-LSTM. The results demonstrate the superiority of the Sup-EnLevel-LSTM strategy. However, the UnSup-PLevel strategy worked surprisingly well without using annotations and frame equalization."

By swapping the variable names in already labelled problems, we generate new problem instances that do not require any further labelling when viewing the selection as a classification problem. We find this augmentation increases the accuracy of ML models by 63% on average. We study what part of this improvement is due to the balancing of the dataset and what is achieved thanks to further increasing the size of the dataset, concluding that both have a very significant effect. We finish the paper by reflecting on how this idea could be applied in other uses of machine learning in mathematics."

Linear FC measures have been applied to study the differences in AD by splitting neurophysiological signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, into discrete frequency bands and analysing them in isolation from each other. We address this limitation by quantifying cross-frequency FC in addition to the traditional within-band approach. Cross-bispectrum, a higher-order spectral analysis approach, is used to measure the nonlinear FC and is compared with the cross-spectrum, which only measures the linear FC within bands. This work reports the reconstruction of a cross-frequency FC network where each frequency band is treated as a layer in a multilayer network with both inter- and intra-layer edges. Cross-bispectrum detects cross-frequency differences, mainly increased FC in AD cases in δ-θ coupling. Overall, increased strength of low-frequency coupling and decreased level of high-frequency coupling is observed in AD cases in comparison to healthy controls (HC). We demonstrate that a graph-theoretic analysis of cross-frequency brain networks is crucial to obtain a more detailed insight into their structure and function. Vulnerability analysis reveals that the integration and segregation properties of networks are enabled by different frequency couplings in AD networks compared to HCs. Finally, we use the reconstructed networks for classification. The extra cross-frequency coupling information can improve the classification performance significantly, suggesting an important role of cross-frequency FC. The results highlight the importance of studying nonlinearity and including cross-frequency FC in characterising AD."

      "abstract": "Remote Human Activity Recognition (HAR) in a private residential area has a beneficial influence on the elderly population's life, since this group of people require regular monitoring of health conditions. This paper addresses the problem of continuous detection of daily human activities using mm-wave Doppler radar. Unlike most previous research, this work records the data in terms of continuous series of activities rather than individual activities. These series of activities are similar to real-life activity patterns. The Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm is used for the detection of human activities in the recorded time series of data and compared to other time-series classification methods. DTW requires less amount of labelled data. The input for DTW was provided using three strategies, and the obtained results were compared against each other. The first approach uses the pixel-level data of frames (named UnSup-PLevel). In the other two strategies, a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) is used to extract Un-Supervised Encoded features (UnSup-EnLevel) and Supervised Encoded features (Sup-EnLevel) from the series of Doppler frames. Results demonstrates the superiority of the Sup-EnLevel features over UnSup-EnLevel and UnSup-PLevel strategies. However, the performance of the UnSup-PLevel strategy worked surprisingly well without using annotations."

      "abstract": "Much effort has been made in the past decades to citation function classification, but noteworthy issues exist. Annotation difficulty resulted in limited data size, especially for minority classes, and inadequate representativeness of the underlying scientific domains. Concerning algorithmic classification, state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods are flawed by generating a feature vector for the whole citation context (or sentence) and failing to exploit the full realm of citation modelling options. Responding to these issues, this paper studied contextualised citation function classification. Specifically, a large new citation context dataset was created by merging and re-annotating six datasets about computational linguistics. A variety of strong SciBERT-based citation function classification models were proposed, and new states of the art were achieved. Through deeper performance analysis, this study focused on answering several research questions about the effective ways of performing citation function classification. More specifically, the study justified the necessity of modelling in-text citations in context and confirmed the superiority of doing citation function classification at citation (segment) level. A particular emphasis was placed on in-depth per-class performance analysis to understand whether citation function classification is robust enough to suit various popular downstream applications and what further efforts are required to meet such analytic needs. Finally, a naïve ensemble classifier was proposed, which greatly improved citation function classification performance."

      "abstract": "Signals measured with multiple sensors simultaneously in time form multivariate signals and are commonly acquired in biomedical imaging. These temporal signals are generally not independent of each other, but exhibit a rich spatial structure. Graph filtering, either spatial or spectral, is a method that can leverage this spatial structure for various preprocessing tasks, such as graph denoising. Previous studies have focused on learning the parameters of spatial graph impulse response (GIR) filters, while neglecting spectral graph frequency response (GFR) filters, even though GFR filters offer unique advantages in terms of regularisation and interpretation. In this study, we therefore compare learning GIR filters and GFR filters as a trainable preprocessing step for two different neural networks on an Alzheimer’s classification task. We tested both a functional connectivity graph as well as a geometric graph as the base of each filter type, and varied the localisation of the spatial filter. As expected, the retrieved shapes of the trained filters suggest that GFR filters can be interpreted in terms of their graph structure, while the same does not hold for GIR filters. Contrarily, however, we found that only the geometric, highly localised GIR filter outperforms the baseline significantly, surpassing it by 3.8 percentage points. These findings suggest that the observed performance boost of a trained localised GIR filter may in fact not be due to the graph structure. Instead, we hypothesise that this boost is caused by favourable algebraic properties of the filter matrix."

To date, these experiments have been limited by computational cost and inability to model multiple scenarios. With improved data quality and availability, machine learning has enormous potential to supplement, or even replace, existing numerical methods. This article presents both an outline of the importance of protecting mangrove environments and a review of methods currently used to quantify the capacity of mangroves to adapt to climate change impacts. In view of the limitations of existing numerical methods, the article also discusses the potential of machine learning as an efficient and effective alternative."

      "abstract": "The quantification of causality is vital for understanding various important phenomena in nature and laboratories, such as brain networks, environmental dynamics, and pathologies. The two most widely used methods for measuring causality are Granger Causality (GC) and Transfer Entropy (TE), which rely on measuring the improvement in the prediction of one process based on the knowledge of another process at an earlier time. However, they have their own limitations, e.g., in applications to nonlinear, non-stationary data, or non-parametric models. In this study, we propose an alternative approach to quantify causality through information geometry that overcomes such limitations. Specifically, based on the information rate that measures the rate of change of the time-dependent distribution, we develop a model-free approach called information rate causality that captures the occurrence of the causality based on the change in the distribution of one process caused by another. This measurement is suitable for analyzing numerically generated non-stationary, nonlinear data. The latter are generated by simulating different types of discrete autoregressive models which contain linear and nonlinear interactions in unidirectional and bidirectional time-series signals. Our results show that information rate causality can capture the coupling of both linear and nonlinear data better than GC and TE in the several examples explored in the paper."

This paper proposes an effective word-level adversarial attack method based on sememes and an improved quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm. The sememe-based substitute method, which uses the words sharing the same sememes as the substitutes of the original words, is first employed to form the reduced search space. Then, an improved QPSO algorithm, so-called historical information guided QPSO with random drift local attractor (HIQPSO-RD), is proposed to search the reduced search space for adversarial examples. The HIQPSO-RD introduces historical information into the current mean best position of the QPSO, for the purpose of improving the convergence speed of the algorithm, by enhancing its exploration ability and preventing the premature convergence of the swarm. The proposed algorithm employs the random drift local attractor technique to make a good balance between its exploration and exploitation, so that the algorithm can find a better adversarial attack example with low grammaticality and perplexity. In addition, it employs a two-stage diversity control strategy to enhance the search performance of the algorithm. Experiments on three natural language processing (NLP) datasets, with three commonly used nature language processing models as victim models, show that our method achieves higher attack success rates and with lower modification rates than the state-of-the-art adversarial attack methods. Moreover, the results of human evaluations show that adversarial examples generated by our method can better maintain the semantic similarity and grammatical correctness of the original input."

The procedure is a high-risk procedure and it could lead to major complications or even procedure-related death. Recently, an Electra Registry Outcome Score (EROS) was designed to create a risk assessment tool using the data about personal health records and an accuracy of 0.70 was achieved. In this paper, we hypothesized that a coil inside the superior vena cava (SVC) is a very important risk factor. By integrating it into the risk assessment model, the accuracy can be further improved. Therefore, an automatic detection method was developed to localize the positions of coils in the X-ray images. It was based on a U-Net convolutional network. To determine the coil position relative to the SVC position inside the chest X-ray image, the heart region was first detected by using a modified VGG16 model. Then, the bounding box of the SVC can be estimated based on the heart anatomy. Finally, a XGBoost classifier was trained on the data about personal health records and the risk factor about the coil position. An accuracy of 0.85 was achieved."

Furthermore, there have been significant advancements in Computer Vision (CV) and Deep Learning (DL) methodologies. These factors have promoted the solutions for designing automatic patient's activity monitoring models. Then, improving such systems’ performance to assist patients and physiotherapists has attracted wide interest of the research community. This paper provides a comprehensive and up-to-date literature review on different stages of skeleton data acquisition processes for the aim of physio exercise monitoring. Then, the previously reported Artificial Intelligence (AI) - based methodologies for skeleton data analysis will be reviewed. In particular, feature learning from skeleton data, evaluation, and feedback generation for the purpose of rehabilitation monitoring will be studied. Furthermore, the associated challenges to these processes will be reviewed. Finally, the paper puts forward several suggestions for future research directions in this area."

      "abstract": "Speed breeding has recently emerged as an innovative agricultural technology solution to meet the ever-increasing global food demand. In speed breeding, typically various light qualities (e.g., colour, duration, intensity) are modified to manipulate the circadian clock of the plants, which in turn alter the plant growth and enhance the productivity such as by reducing the flowering time. In order to develop a comprehensive framework describing plant growth, a model incorporating the effect of various light qualities on plant growth needs to be established. Recently a mathematical model of the plant circadian clock for Arabidopsis thaliana has been developed to characterise the hypocotyl growth subject to multiple light quality properties. This is a first step towards developing a more comprehensive model that links light quality, plant circadian clock and plant growth. In this work, we extend the model by adding the effect of various light qualities on the flowering time. The proposed model can capture the flowering time behaviours of plant when subject to red, blue, and mixed lights and can be used to guide experiment of light properties manipulation for optimised plant growth via hypocotyl growth and flowering time."

Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (HQPSO) algorithm to alleviate the above problems. In the HQPSO, the Solis and Wets local search method is used to enhance the local search ability of the QPSO so that the algorithm can find solutions that is close to optimal when the constraints are met, and two evolution operators are proposed and incorporated for the purpose of making a better balance between local search and global search abilities at the later search stage. The performance comparison is made among the HQPSO and the other ten population-based random search methods under two different experimental configurations and four different power systems in terms of solution quality, robustness, and convergence property. The experimental results show that the HQPSO improves the convergence properties of the QPSO and finally obtains the best total generation cost without violating any constraints. In addition, the HQPSO outperforms all the other algorithms on 7 cases of all 8 experimental cases in terms of global best position and mean position, which verifies the effectiveness of the algorithm."

Previous studies have relied on functional connectivity methods to infer brain graph structures and used simple GNN architectures for the diagnosis of AD. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive gated graph convolutional network (AGGCN) that can provide explainable predictions. AGGCN adaptively learns graph structures by combining convolution-based node feature enhancement with a correlation-based measure of power spectral density similarity. Furthermore, the gated graph convolution can dynamically weigh the contribution of various spatial scales. The proposed model achieves high accuracy in both eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions, indicating the stability of learned representations. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed AGGCN model generates consistent explanations of its predictions that might be relevant for further study of AD-related alterations of brain networks."

      "abstract": "LED lights have become very popular recently for smart farming applications, where they provide artificial light as the substitute for sunlight in a greenhouse or indoor farming environment. To ensure a low total operational cost and improve the efficiency of farming in those environments, it is imperative that the overall LED lighting system is energy efficient. LED is a dc system, whereas the grid is an ac system. As such, an LED driver is needed to perform the necessary voltage conversion. The boost power factor correction (PFC) converter is a popular LED driver that provides output voltage regulation and power factor correction at the same time. As the LED driver is grid-connected, its control system requires real-time estimation of the grid voltage parameter information for reference current generation. In this study, a comparison between frequency-and phase-locked loops as the grid detection method inside the converter control system is provided. For the phase-locked loop (PLL), a single-phase quasi-type-1 structure is considered. It is then compared with the conventional second-order generalised integrator (SOGI)frequency-locked loop (FLL). Comprehensive numerical studies are performed to evaluate the performance of FLL and PLL in challenging grid voltage cases. Results show that the source current has a lower total harmonic distortion when PLL is used as the synchronisation tool over the FLL counterpart. This can be attributed to the use of moving average filter in the PLL, which provides additional harmonic robustness compared to FLL. Lower distortion by the PLL method will the make LED driver, consequently smart farming more energy efficient."

      "abstract": "With the UK government's target of Net Zero by 2050, alongside the rising cost of energy in the UK, it is imperative that public opinion aligns with and promotes affordable, greener energy systems. Within this dialogue, young people’s voices and lived experience are needed to deepen the impact of energy policy intervention strategies. This article stresses the importance of a formal curriculum that informs future generations on the subjects of Smart Local Energy Systems (SLES), and the digitalisation advances of energy systems. This paper explores the development of a toolkit to educate and engage young people in these subjects, and reviews young people’s attitudes and understanding from three schools in England, UK. We find through an interpretive qualitative analysis of both images drawn by the young people, and insights gathered from focus groups, that i) for these young people, SLES are a useful innovation regarding energy management and distribution, ii) young people recognise that the education system as it currently stands is not aware of, or informed by smart energy technologies and iii) that despite being a generation that is the most integrated with personal assistance technology, these young people have significant concerns over the reliability and safety of AI in SLES.

      "abstract": "The Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR) is an important indicator for health risk prediction, body fat distribution, body shape analysis, and physical fitness analysis. The conventional approach for obtaining the WHR entails manual measurement, which necessitates experienced anthropometrists to measure the waist and hip circumferences of a subject wearing tight clothing in a predetermined posture, and subsequently calculate the ratio based on the acquired measurements. WHR errors may be accumulated due to the anthropometrist’s subjectivity, as well as the person’s pose and attire during the measurement process. Non-contact anthropometric measurements using 3D scanning technology have shown promise in providing higher accuracy and faster measurement compared to traditional methods. However, they require complete undressed body scans as input, which is not always available. In this paper, we proposed, to the best of our knowledge, the first deep learning-based algorithm, dubbed W2H-Net, to predict the WHR directly from single partial dressed body scans in arbitrary postures. W2H-Net introduces a novel framework called FocusNet to improve learning accuracy by selectively focusing on parts that require attention. W2H-Net provides a flexible, cost-effective, and privacy-preserving way to obtain accurate WHR measurements, which are crucial for predicting health risks associated with central obesity. Extensive experimental results can demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method."

      "abstract": "Premature convergence is a thorny problem for particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms, especially on multimodal problems, where maintaining swarm diversity is crucial. However, most enhancement strategies for PSO, including the existing diversity-guided strategies, have not fully addressed this issue. This paper proposes the virtual position guided (VPG) strategy for PSO algorithms. The VPG strategy calculates diversity values for two different populations and establishes a diversity baseline. It then dynamically guides the algorithm to conduct different search behaviors, through three phases - divergence, normal, and acceleration - in each iteration, based on the relationships among these diversity values and the baseline. Collectively, these phases orchestrate different schemes to balance exploration and exploitation, collaboratively steering the algorithm away from local optima and towards enhanced solution quality. The introduction of ‘virtual position’ caters to the strategy's adaptability across various PSO algorithms, ensuring the generality and effectiveness of the proposed VPG strategy. With a single hyperparameter and a recommended usual setup, VPG is easy to implement. The experimental results demonstrate that the VPG strategy is superior to several canonical and the state-of-the-art strategies for diversity guidance, and is effective in improving the search performance of most PSO algorithms on multimodal problems of various dimensionalities."

      "abstract": "Multivariate signals measured simultaneously over time by sensor networks are becoming increasingly common. The emerging field of graph signal processing (GSP) promises to analyse spectral characteristics of these multivariate signals, while also taking the spatial structure between the time signals into account. A core idea in GSP is the graph Fourier transform, which projects a multivariate signal onto frequency-ordered graph Fourier modes and can be regarded as a spatial analogue of the classical Fourier transform. This chapter derives and discusses key concepts in GSP, with a specific focus on understanding the differences between parallel formulations and the interconnections between the various concepts. The experimental section focuses on the role of graph frequency in data classification, with applications to neuroimaging. To shed light on graph frequencies individually, sample sizes larger than those of relevant empirical data sets are needed. We therefore introduce a minimalist simulation to generate sufficiently many signals, which share key characteristics with neurophysiological signals. Using this artificial data, we find that higher graph frequency signals are more suitable for classification as compared to lower graph frequency signals and propose GSP mechanisms to explain our findings. Finally, we present a baseline testing framework for GSP. Using this framework, our results suggest that GSP may be applicable for dimensionality reduction in neurophysiological signals."

      "abstract": "Quantifying uncertainty in complex hydro-morphodynamics models, particularly those governed by the Navier–Stokes partial differential equations (PDE), is a challenging task due to the complex and highly non-linear relationship of high-dimensional inputs and outputs, coupled with inherent computational complexity. Traditional surrogate models, which provide an efficient approximation of the underlying expensive model, exemplified by the Gaussian process (GP), encounter limitations in accurately capturing the non-Gaussian nature inherent in the input/output relationship. Such limitations restrict their applicability to simpler problems. Furthermore, the applicability of newer hybrid surrogates, such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), for uncertainty quantification (UQ) is hindered by the significant computational cost of quantifying uncertainty, which requires a large number of parameters to optimise.\nThis research addresses these challenges by leveraging an efficient non-linear GP model known as the deep Gaussian process (deep GP), which is designed to the complexities of deep learning and modelling high-dimensional complex systems. This model is structured with multiple hidden layers interconnected by non-linear mappings. We explore the applicability of deep Gaussian processes, including their adaptation to replace a complex numerical model that solves the Navier–Stokes equations to model the hydro-morphodynamics around mangrove environments, and development of a novel UQ and uncertainty for deep GP for this high-resolution complex model. The derived findings reveal that the deep GP exhibits remarkable improvements in efficiency, significantly surpassing the baseline UQ method in terms of computational time and accuracy level. Concurrently, it demonstrates an accuracy improvement of over 5 orders of magnitude when contrasted with the standard GP model. Moreover, the deep GP exhibits superior robustness in quantifying uncertainty amidst diverse spatio-temporal complexities compared to its GP counterpart. This research significantly advances the understanding and application of uncertainty quantification in the field of hydro-morphodynamics with significant real-world implications for climate change adaptation and protection mitigation decisions."

We train transformers that predict whether a particular integration method will be successful, and compare against the existing human-made heuristics (called guards) that perform this task in a leading CAS. We find the transformer can outperform these guards, gaining up to 30% accuracy and 70% precision. We further show that the inference time of the transformer is inconsequential which shows that it is well-suited to include as a guard in a CAS. Furthermore, we use Layer Integrated Gradients to interpret the decisions that the transformer is making. If guided by a subject-matter expert, the technique can explain some of the predictions based on the input tokens, which can lead to further optimisations."

This paper addresses the problem of finding and energizing a proper communication network connecting the distributed power grid assets in the restoration process, assuming a probability of infeasibility of recovering each communication node. The proper network has the minimum size, meets the communication requirements of power system recovery, and guarantees robustness against ICT nodes not being recoverable during restoration. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem and solved using the genetic algorithm to find the optimal subgraph that ensures enough node-disjoint paths between the communicating power grid assets. Simulation results for the restoration strategy of the communication network associated with a power network are provided and discussed. The results show that networks’ ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of node failures can be significantly improved by incorporating just a few additional nodes and links while keeping the ICT network compact and feasible for restoration."

Choosing the right sub-algorithm for a given problem is challenging: we hypothesise that Machine Learning can guide this sub-algorithm choice. A key consideration of our methodology is how to represent the mathematics to the ML model: we hypothesise that a representation which encodes the tree structure of mathematical expressions would be well suited. We trained both an LSTM and a TreeLSTM model for sub-algorithm prediction and compared them to Maple's existing approach. Our TreeLSTM performs much better than the LSTM, highlighting the benefit of using an informed representation of mathematical expressions. It is able to produce better outputs than Maple's current state-of-the-art meta-algorithm, giving a strong basis for further research."

This concept was previously adapted to graph structures, whereby heat flows between nodes of a graph depending on the graph topology. Here, we combine the graph heat equation with the stochastic heat equation, which ultimately yields a model for multivariate time signals on a graph. We show theoretically how the model can be used to directly compute the diffusion-based connectivity structure from multivariate signals. Unlike other connectivity measures, our heat model-based approach is inherently multivariate and yields an absolute scaling factor, namely the graph thermal diffusivity, which captures the extent of heat-like graph propagation in the data. On two datasets, we show how the graph thermal diffusivity can be used to characterise Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We find that the graph thermal diffusivity is lower for AD patients than healthy controls and correlates with mini–mental state examination (MMSE) scores, suggesting structural impairment in patients in line with previous findings.Clinical relevance— This study introduces a novel heat-based connectivity measure, which allows to characterise Alzheimer’s disease in terms of the graph thermal diffusivity."

After establishing suitable ranges through a comprehensive literature review, these properties varied within those ranges. Compared to white light, a 16-h cycle of blue light reduces DTF and hypocotyl length by 12 % and 3 %, respectively. Interestingly, similar results can be achieved using a shorter photoperiod of 14-h light (composed of 8 h of a mixture of 66.7 μmol m-2s-1 red and 800 μmol m-2s-1 blue lights (i.e. blue:red ratio of 12:1) followed by 6 h of monochromatic red light and 10-h dark.

This research combines the latest developments in surrogate modelling and physics-informed machine learning to propose a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network-based surrogate model for hydrodynamic simulators governed by Shallow Water Equations. The proposed method incorporates physics-based prior information into the neural network structure by encoding the conservation of mass into the model without relying on calculating continuous derivatives in the loss function. The method is demonstrated for a high-resolution inland flood simulation model and a large-scale regional tidal model. The proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art data-driven approaches by up to 25 %. This research demonstrates the benefits and robustness of physics-informed approaches in surrogate modelling for flood and hydroclimatic modelling problems."

In addition to increased exposure and risk of sexual violence, displaced women and young girls must contend with inequality in accessing information, decision-making and economic opportunities at local and governmental levels. Energy interventions can be instrumental in reducing inequities, but energy use and access is also highly gendered in the displaced context. Drawing upon empirical research of the experiences of Congolese refugees in Rwanda and internally displaced people in Nepal, this chapter will explore to what extent improved energy access benefits men and women equally. Discussing how women and young girls negotiate gender and energy could shift the narrative regarding refugees, particularly women and young people, from recipients to participants in energy planning, procurement, and delivery."

In particular, the accurate turbulence statistical description of self-regulation and causal relation among turbulence and shear flows is essential for accessing enhanced plasma performance and advanced operation scenarios. To address this, we provide a nonperturbative theory of the L-H transition by stochastic simulations of a reduced L-H transition model and detailed statistical analysis. By calculating time-dependent probability density functions (PDFs) of turbulence, zonal flows, and the mean pressure gradient, we elucidate how statistical properties change over time with the help of the information geometry theory (information rate, causal information rate), highlighting its utility in capturing self-regulation and causal relation among turbulence, zonal flow shears, and the mean flow shears. Furthermore, stochastic noises in turbulence, zonal flows, and/or input power are shown to induce uncertainty in the power threshold 𝑄𝑐 above which the L-H transition occurs while leading to a rather gradual L-H transition. A time-dependent PDF of power loss over the L-H transition is presented."

Reaching such capabilities will require significant technological attention and the flawless execution of various complex tasks, one of which is ensuring robust localization and mapping. Recent surveys have not provided a meaningful and comprehensive description of the current approaches in this field. Accordingly, this review is intended to provide adequate coverage of the problems affecting autonomous vehicles in this area, by examining the most recent methods for mapping and localization as well as related feature extraction and data security problems. First, a discussion of the contemporary methods of extracting relevant features from equipped sensors and their categorization as semantic, non-semantic, and deep learning methods is presented. We conclude that representativeness, low cost, and accessibility are crucial constraints in the choice of the methods to be adopted for localization and mapping tasks. Second, the survey focuses on methods to build a vehicle’s environment map, considering both the commercial and the academic solutions available. The analysis proposes a difference between two types of environment, known and unknown, and develops solutions in each case. Third, the survey explores different approaches to vehicle localization and also classifies them according to their mathematical characteristics and priorities. Each section concludes by presenting the related challenges and some future directions. The article also highlights the security problems likely to be encountered in self-driving vehicles, with an assessment of possible defense mechanisms that could prevent security attacks in vehicles. Finally, the article ends with a debate on the potential impacts of autonomous driving, spanning energy consumption and emission reduction, sound and light pollution, integration into smart cities, infrastructure optimization, and software refinement. This thorough investigation aims to foster a comprehensive understanding of the diverse implications of autonomous driving across various domains."

      "abstract": "Research evidence shows that physical rehabilitation exercises prescribed by medical experts can assist in restoring physical function, improving life quality, and promoting independence for physically disabled individuals. In response to the absence of immediate expert feedback on performed actions, developing a Human Action Evaluation (HAE) system emerges as a valuable automated solution, addressing the need for accurate assessment of exercises and guidance during physical rehabilitation. Previous HAE systems developed for the rehabilitation exercises have focused on developing models that utilize skeleton data as input to compute a quality score for each action performed by the patient. However, existing studies have focused on improving scoring performance while often overlooking computational efficiency. In this research, we propose LightPRA (Light Physical Rehabilitation Assessment) system, an innovative architectural solution based on a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), which harnesses the capabilities of dilated causal Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This approach efficiently captures complex temporal features and characteristics of the skeleton data with lower computational complexity, making it suitable for real-time feedback provided on resource-constrained devices such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices and Edge computing frameworks. Through empirical analysis performed on the University of Idaho-Physical Rehabilitation Movement Data (UI-PRMD) and KInematic assessment of MOvement for remote monitoring of physical REhabilitation (KIMORE) datasets, our proposed LightPRA model demonstrates superior performance over several state-of-the-art approaches such as Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based models in scoring human activity performance, while exhibiting lower computational cost and complexity."

      "abstract": "Satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers check the satisfiability of quantifier-free first-order logic formulae over different theories. We consider the theory of non-linear real arithmetic where the formulae are logical combinations of polynomial constraints. Here a commonly used tool is the cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) to decompose the real space into cells where the constraints are truth-invariant through the use of projection polynomials.\nA CAD encodes more information than necessary for checking satisfiability. One approach to address this is to repackage the CAD theory into a search-based algorithm: one that guesses sample points to satisfy the formula, and generalizes guesses that conflict constraints to cylindrical cells around samples which are avoided in the continuing search. This can lead to a satisfying assignment more quickly, or conclude unsatisfiability with far fewer cells. A notable example of this approach is Jovanović and de Moura's NLSAT algorithm. Since these cells are being produced locally to a sample there is scope to use fewer projection polynomials than the traditional CAD projection. The original NLSAT algorithm reduced the set a little; while Brown's single cell construction reduced it much further still. However, it refines a cell polynomial-by-polynomial, meaning the shape and size of the cell produced depends on the order in which the polynomials are considered.\nThe present paper proposes a method to construct such cells levelwise, i.e. built level-by-level according to a variable ordering instead of polynomial-by-polynomial for all levels. We still use a reduced number of projection polynomials, but can now consider a variety of different reductions and use heuristics to select the projection polynomials in order to optimize the shape of the cell under construction. The new method can thus improve the performance of the NLSAT algorithm. We formulate all the necessary theory that underpins the algorithm as a proof system: while not a common presentation for work in this field, it is valuable in allowing an elegant decoupling of heuristic decisions from the main algorithm and its proof of correctness. We expect the symbolic computation community may find uses for it in other areas too. In particular, the proof system could be a step towards formal proofs for non-linear real arithmetic.\nThis work has been implemented in the SMT-RAT solver and the benefits of the levelwise construction are validated experimentally on the SMT-LIB benchmark library. We also compare several heuristics for the construction and observe that each heuristic has strengths offering potential for further exploitation of the new approach."

This study reports lessons on such use of machine learning in symbolic computation, in particular on the importance of analysing datasets prior to machine learning and on the different machine learning paradigms that may be utilised. We present results for a particular case study, the selection of variable ordering for cylindrical algebraic decomposition, but expect that the lessons learned are applicable to other decisions in symbolic computation. We utilise an existing dataset of examples derived from applications which was found to be imbalanced with respect to the variable ordering decision. We introduce an augmentation technique for polynomial systems problems that allows us to balance and further augment the dataset, improving the machine learning results by 28% and 38% on average, respectively. We then demonstrate how the existing machine learning methodology used for the problem—classification—might be recast into the regression paradigm. While this does not have a radical change on the performance, it does widen the scope in which the methodology can be applied to make choices."

In this article, we fully make use of the consensus and complementary information, and exploit a bipartite graph to depict the duality relationship between original points and anchor points. To be specific, representative anchor points are selected for each view to construct corresponding anchor representation matrices, and all views' anchor points are utilized to construct a common representation matrix. Using anchor points also reduces the computation complexity. Next, the bipartite graph is built by fusing these representation matrices, and a Laplacian rank constraint is enforced on the bipartite graph. This will make the bipartite graph have k connected components to obtain accurate clustering labels, where the bipartite graph is specifically designed for a large-scale dataset problem. In addition, the anchor points are also updated by dictionary learning. The experimental results on the four benchmark image processing datasets have demonstrated superior performance of the proposed large-scale multi-view clustering algorithm over other state-of-the-art multi-view clustering algorithms.

To address this issue, numerous methods have been proposed to enhance the explainability and interpretability of ANNs. In this study, we introduce the application of information geometric framework to investigate phase transition-like behavior during the training of ANNs and relate these transitions to overfitting in certain models. The evolution of ANNs during training is studied by looking at the probability distribution of its parameters. Information geometry utilizing the principles of differential geometry, offers a unique perspective on probability and statistics by considering probability density functions as points on a Riemannian manifold. We create this manifold using a metric based on Fisher information to define a distance and a velocity. By parameterizing this distance and velocity with training steps, we study how the ANN evolves as training progresses. Utilizing standard datasets like MNIST, FMNIST and CIFAR-10, we observe a transition in the motion on the manifold while training the ANN and this transition is identified with over-fitting in the ANN models considered. The information geometric transitions observed is shown to be mathematically similar to the phase transitions in physics. Preliminary results showing finite-size scaling behavior is also provided. This work contributes to the development of robust tools for improving the explainability and interpretability of ANNs, aiding in our understanding of the variability of the parameters these complex models exhibit during training."

However, concurrently achieving high-performance tactile sensing, long-lasting wearing comfort, and industrialized fabrication by a low-cost strategy remains a great challenge. This is primarily due to critical research gaps in novel textile structure design for seamless integration with sensing elements. Here, an all-in-one biaxial insertion knit architecture is reported to topologically integrate sensing units within double-knit loops for the fabrication of a large-scale tactile sensing textile by using low-cost industrial manufacturing routes. High sensitivity, stability, and low hysteresis of arrayed sensing units are achieved through engineering of fractal structures of hierarchically patterned piezoresistive yarns via blistering and twisting processing. The as-prepared tactile sensing textiles show desirable sensing performance and robust mechanical property, while ensuring excellent conformability, tailorability, breathability (288 mm s ), and moisture permeability (3591 g m per day) for minimizing the effect on wearing comfort. The multifunctional applications of tactile sensing textiles are demonstrated in continuously monitoring human motions, tactile interactions with the environment, and recognizing biometric gait. Moreover, we also demonstrate that machine learning-assisted sensing textiles can accurately predict body postures, which holds great promise in advancing the development of personalized healthcare robotics, prosthetics, and intelligent interaction devices."

However, a bottleneck is likely to emerge as the Internet of Vehicles scales up. In this paper, we propose a novel Graphical Consensus-based Sharding (GCS) framework, which is underpinned by four important strategies: 1) A graphical consensus is adopted as its intra-shard consensus, where the consensus group is set up according to its maximal connected subgraph, and the leader is elected by its reliability weight. The consensus group is refreshed intermittently by alternating the leader role. 2) Within GCS, the intra-shard data are stored in the local chain, while a block-based directed acyclic graph, rather than a chained structure, is employed as the main chain. The local chain is used to respond to requests within each shard, and the main chain supports the cross-shard sharings. GCS will parallelly optimize the throughput of the blockchain-enabled Internet of Vehicles. 3) GCS further introduces the shard backup and the node scheduling to handle shard failure and overheating by using new backup strategies and a temporal-spatial graph convolutional network prediction model, respectively. 4) An off-chain transmission algorithm is presented for secure sharing between the infrastructure and the vehicles. Simulation results show that the number of Transactions Per Second is 1.69 times higher than that of the non-sharding blockchain, and the pending time is dramatically reduced compared to the mainstreaming sharding approach, which is 1.02s."

Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used approach for model compression. However, when applied in the object detection problems, the existing KD methods either directly applies the feature map or simply separate the foreground from the background by using a binary mask, aligning the attention between the teacher and the student models. Unfortunately, these methods either completely overlook or fail to thoroughly eliminate noise, resulting in unsatisfactory model accuracy for student models. To address this issue, we propose a foreground separation distillation (FSD) method in this paper. The FSD method enables student models to distinguish between foreground and background using Gaussian heatmaps, reducing irrelevant information in the learning process. Additionally, FSD also extracts the channel feature by converting the spatial feature maps into probabilistic forms to fully utilize the knowledge in each channel of a well-trained teacher. Experimental results demonstrate that the YOLOX detector enhanced with our distillation method achieved superior performance on both the fall detection and the VOC2007 datasets. For example, YOLOX with FSD achieved 73.1% mean average precision (mAP) on the Fall Detection dataset, which is 1.6% higher than the baseline. The code of FSD is accessible via https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13829676."

      "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) methods have become an important tool for modelling and forecasting complex high-dimensional spatiotemporal datasets such as those found in environmental and climate modelling applications. ML approaches can offer a fast, low-cost alternative to short-term forecasting than expensive numerical simulation while addressing a significant outstanding limitation of numerical modelling by being able to robustly and dynamically quantify predictive uncertainty. Low-cost and near-instantaneous forecasting of high-level climate variables has clear applications in early warning systems, nowcasting, and parameterising small-scale locally relevant simulations. This paper presents a novel approach for multi-task spatiotemporal regression by combining data-driven autoencoders with Gaussian Processes (GP) to produce a probabilistic tensor-based regression model. The proposed method is demonstrated for forecasting one-step-ahead temperature and pressure on a global scale simultaneously. By conducting probabilistic regression in the learned latent space, samples can be propagated back to the original feature space to produce uncertainty estimates at a vastly reduced computational cost. The composite GP-autoencoder model was able to simultaneously forecast global temperature and pressure values with average errors of 3.82 °C and 638 hPa, respectively. Further, on average the true values were within the proposed posterior distribution 95.6% of the time illustrating that the model produces a well-calibrated predictive posterior distribution."

      "abstract": "Sentiment analysis aims to identify the sentiment polarity of specific aspects within given sentences or comments, and aspect-based sentiment analysis is considered a fundamental task in sentiment analysis. With practical applications in areas such as product reviews, food delivery evaluations, and public opinion monitoring, sentiment analysis plays a crucial role. This paper focuses on the application of fine-grained sentiment analysis in financial distress prediction (FDP) to enhance early warnings of the management status of companies. In previous studies, there has been a narrow emphasis on using document-level sentiment analysis to extract overall sentiment from text, overlooking the semantic nuances conveyed by sentiments. Therefore, this paper aims to extract fine-grained sentiments from the Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A) of Chinese listed companies. The proposed model is based on a two-step framework, consisting of an unsupervised aspect-level financial sentiment extraction phase and a model validation phase. Specifically, the former is built on a deep learning model with an attention mechanism, conducting unsupervised aspect extraction, aspect identification, and aspect-level sentiment classification in a sequential manner to obtain fine-grained sentiments. The latter is responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of the newly acquired features on benchmark machine learning models, including SVM, DT, LR, CNN, and DNN. Experimental results reveal that MD&A predominantly covers eight types of aspects, including ownership, business scope, development, capital, sales, management, prizes, and probability. Additionally, it has been observed that fine-grained sentiment features can enhance the performance of FDP. This study represents a significant innovation in existing literature, being the first to introduce aspect-level financial sentiment analysis into the realm of FDP."

The particular focus of this study is on addressing the scarcity of labelled images. This paper introduces several contributions, including a systematic satellite image data augmentation approach that aims to maintain data population consistency during model training, thus mitigating performance degradation. To alleviate the labour-intensive task of pixel-wise image labelling, we present a novel application of a modified conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) to generate artificial satellite images and corresponding farm labels. Additionally, we scrutinize the role of spectral bands in satellite image segmentation and compare two prominent semantic segmentation models, U-Net and DeepLabV3+, with diverse backbone structures. Our empirical findings demonstrate that augmenting the dataset with up to 22.85% artificial samples significantly enhances the model performance. Notably, the U-Net model, employing standard convolution, outperforms the DeepLabV3+ models with atrous convolution, achieving a segmentation accuracy of 86.92% on the test data."

The examples we consider include a stiff coupled ODE system where traditional numerical methods fail, a 3+1D non-linear PDE, Kovasznay flow and Taylor–Green vortex solutions to incompressible Navier–Stokes equations and pure advection solution of 1+1 D compressible Euler equation.\nThe Theory of Functional Connections (TFC) is used to exactly impose initial and boundary conditions (IBCs) of (I)BVPs on PINNs. We propose a modification to the TFC framework named Reduced TFC and show a significant improvement in the training and inference time of PINNs compared to IBCs imposed using TFC. Furthermore, Reduced TFC is shown to be able to generalize to more complex boundary geometries which is not possible with TFC. We also introduce a method of applying boundary conditions at infinity for BVPs and numerically solve the pure advection in 1+1 D Euler equations using these boundary conditions."

      "abstract": "For over a century, induction furnaces have been used in the core of foundries for metal melting and heating. They provide high melting/heating rates with optimal efficiency. The occurrence of faults not only imposes safety risks but also reduces productivity due to unscheduled shutdowns. The problem of diagnosing faults in induction furnaces has not yet been studied, and this work is the first to propose a data-driven framework for diagnosing faults in this application. This paper presents a deep neural network framework for diagnosing electrical faults by measuring real-time electrical parameters at the supply side. Experimental and sensory measurements are collected from multiple energy analyzer devices installed in the foundry. Next, a semi-supervised learning approach, known as the local outlier factor, has been used to discriminate normal and faulty samples from each other and label the data samples. Then, a deep neural network is trained with the collected labeled samples. The performance of the developed model is compared with several state-of-the-art techniques in terms of various performance metrics. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the selected deep neural network model over other classifiers, with an average F-measure of 0.9187. Due to the black box nature of the constructed neural network, the model predictions are interpreted by Shapley additive explanations and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations. The interpretability analysis reveals that classified faults are closely linked to variations in odd voltage/current harmonics of order 3, 11, 13, and 17, highlighting the critical impact of these parameters on the model’s prediction."

We present a case study on the use of ML to select the variable ordering for cylindrical algebraic decomposition.

      "abstract": "Compared to feature engineering, deep learning approaches for citation context analysis have yet fully leveraged the myriad of design options for modeling in-text citation, citation sentence, and citation context. In fact, no single modeling option universally excels on all citation function classes or annotation schemes, which implies the untapped potential for synergizing diverse modeling approaches to further elevate the performance of citation context analysis. Motivated by this insight, the current paper undertook a systematic exploration of ensemble methods for citation context analysis. To achieve a better diverse set of base classifiers, we delved into three sources of classifier diversity, incorporated five diversity measures, and introduced two novel diversity re-ranking methods. Then, we conducted a comprehensive examination of both voting and stacking approaches for constructing classifier ensembles. We also proposed a novel weighting method that considers each individual classifier’s performance, resulting in superior voting outcomes. While being simple, voting approaches faced significant challenges in determining the optimal number of base classifiers for combination. Several strategies have been proposed to address this limitation, including meta-classification on base classifiers and utilising deeper ensemble architectures. The latter involved hierarchical voting on a filtered set of meta-classifiers and stacked meta-classification. All proposed methods demonstrate state-of-the-art results on, with the best performances achieving more than 5% and 4% improvements on the 11-class and 6-class schemes of citation function classification and by 3% on important citation screening. The promising empirical results validated the potential of our ensembling approaches for citation context analysis."

Combined with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), artificial intelligence, and computer vision, SAR operations can be revolutionized through enabling rescuers to expand ground coverage with improved detection accuracy whilst reducing costs and personal injury risks. However, detecting small objects is one of the significant challenges associated with using computer vision on UAVs. Several approaches have been proposed for improving small object detection, including data augmentation techniques like replication and variation of image sizes, but their suitability for SAR application characteristics remains questionable. To address these issues, this paper evaluates four float detection algorithms against the baseline and augmented datasets to improve float detection for maritime SAR. Results demonstrated that YOLOv8 and YOLOv5 outperformed the others in which F1 scores ranged from 82.9 to 95.3%, with an enhancement range of 0.1–29.2%.

In this study, we comprehensively explored the potential early detection of gout flares (GFs) based on nurses’ chief complaint notes in the Emergency Department (ED). Addressing the challenge of identifying GFs prospectively during an ED visit, where documentation is typically minimal, our research focused on employing alternative Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to enhance detection accuracy. We investigated GF detection algorithms using both sparse representations by traditional NLP methods and dense encodings by medical domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs), distinguishing between generative and discriminative models. Three methods were used to alleviate the issue of severe data imbalances, including oversampling, class weights, and focal loss. Extensive empirical studies were performed on the Gout Emergency Department Chief Complaint Corpora. Sparse text representations like tf-idf proved to produce strong performances, achieving F1 scores higher than 0.75. The best deep learning models were RoBERTa-large-PM-M3-Voc and BioGPT, which had the best F1 scores for each dataset, with a 0.8 on the 2019 dataset and a 0.85 F1 score on the 2020 dataset, respectively. We concluded that although discriminative LLMs performed better for this classification task when compared to generative LLMs, a combination of using generative models as feature extractors and employing a support vector machine for classification yielded promising results comparable to those obtained with discriminative models."

      "abstract": "Early detection of diabetic retinopathy, a complication of vision loss in advanced stages of diabetes, is essential to avoid permanent blindness. However, the automatic detection of diabetic retinopathy through medical image processing requires a large number of training data to build a model with good performance. This poses a challenge when working with small datasets as these models need large datasets to perform well on unseen data. In this paper, we design a few-shot Siamese Neural Networks combined with pre-trained models, such as VGG16, ResNet50, and DenseNet121, to effectively differentiate between classes using small lesions in the retinal images. The proposed model is trained based on the similarity between the pair of images using a comparatively small dataset and performs well for a five-class classification problem. We use the Fine-Grained Annotated Diabetic Retinopathy (FGADR) and APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection dataset, where a small ratio of training images is used to train the model. To evaluate our model, we conduct the testing on the remaining data and achieve good accuracy when trained on limited images, with fewer epochs and fewer parameters. The proposed model achieves high accuracy rates on five-class classification of 80% on FGADR and 81% on APTOS 2019 datasets, with a consistent quadratic weighted kappa (QWK) score of 0.89 across both datasets. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of hyperparameter optimisation, specifically investigating different pair selection techniques, loss functions, and distance layers to thoroughly evaluate their impact on the performance of the model. Our proposed model demonstrates promising results when combined with an attention mechanism to perform multiclass classification of diabetic retinopathy using a limited number of eye fundus images, outperforming existing approaches with only a small number of epochs in training."

The results show that the constraint relaxation method provides an improved estimation for the upper bound, whereas the truncated exponential distribution tightens the lower bound with a minimum gap of 0.4 bit/s/Hz during rush hour and in a clear weather condition. We also show that the average capacity bounds of V2V-VLC are less affected by atmospheric turbulence and fog, and that the capacity during rush hours is higher by 0.7 bit/s/Hz than during late hours."

      "abstract": "Recent studies have witnessed the prosperity of image semantic segmentation brought by deep learning technology, including the integration of diverse network structures, attention mechanisms, and even boundary perception. Essentially, the main challenge of semantic segmentation lies in how to incorporate and align more information like contexts and details in the feature representation enabling the network to better distinguish and recognize objects in an image for improved semantic understanding. To this end, we propose a novel end-to-end deep framework termed Attention-Based Multi-Kernelized and Boundary-Aware Network to enhance the semantic segmentation performance. Specifically, the proposed network enables thoroughly exploring and engaging the multi-kernelized contextual information with high-frequency boundary information by applying novel modules of Multi-Kernelized Spatial Attention and Boundary-Aware Hybrid Attention, aiming to enhance the segmentation result with more comprehensive feature representation capability. Extensive experiments further consolidate the superiority of the proposed network with improved segmentation results with the mIoU of 51.1% and 82.9% on ADE20K and Cityscapes datasets, as well as classification results with Top-1 accuracy of 84.0% on ImageNet-1K dataset against competitive baselines."

      "abstract": "Comprehending the complexity of pipe flow dynamics is important for a variety of sectors, including environmental, industrial, and engineering research. Conventional techniques such as Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) have long been the heart of these kinds of investigations, but they are often quite expensive and complex. Our research offers a novel, affordable visualization method that aims to transform the way we examine and interpret flow dynamics in response to these challenges. Our method is developed to utilize a low-cost camera system with a simple laser setup to investigate fluid dynamics inside pipes. By introducing particles into the flow and manipulating the camera shutter speed in real-time under the laser, we created streaks capable of displaying complex flow patterns. We gathered precise information about streak angles using rigorous image processing, providing clarity in our insights into the flow dynamics of the particulate pipe flow. Notably, our strategy eliminates the need for expensive and sophisticated equipment while providing researchers and practitioners with a simple yet reliable alternative. The potential for improving our knowledge of pipe flow dynamics is shown by preliminary studies that demonstrate how well it captures dynamic flow characteristics. Our technique, which is easy to use and effective, promises fresh insights into fluid dynamics and opens up new avenues for pipe flow analysis, making it suitable for a broad spectrum of users."

Existing research addresses the ECPE task through a two-step or an end-to-end approach. Although previous work shows promising performances, they suffer from two limitations: 1) they fail to take full advantage of emotion type information, which has advantages for modelling the dependencies between emotion and cause clauses from a semantic perspective; 2) they ignored the interaction between local and global information, which is important for ECPE. To address these issues, we propose an ECPE Pair Generator (ECPE-PG), with a Clause-Encoder layer, a Pre-Output layer and an Information Interaction-based Pair Generation (IIPG) Module embedded. This model first encodes clauses into vector representations through the Clause-Encoder layer and then preforms emotion clause extraction (EE), cause clause extraction (CE) and emotion type extraction (ETE), respectively, through the Pre-Output layer, on the basis of which the IIPG module analyzes the complex emotional logic of relationships between clauses and estimates the candidate pairs based on the interaction of global and local information. It should be noted that emotion type information is regarded as a crucial indication in the IIPG module to assist the identification of emotion-cause pairs. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets."

Meanwhile, there is a belief that in care settings unobtrusive sensors and physical robots will eventually address this challenge. However, research into factors influencing older users' acceptance of such technology in these environments has received little attention. This paper describes a study undertaken in a UK care home ‘living lab' environment exploring older people's preferences for sensors and robots. An in-depth qualitative study examined the preferences of a cross-section of 21 older adults (aged 81-99) in the care home setting. In addition to two dimensions (usefulness and ease-of-use) included in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) framework, the importance of other elements such as physical appearance, functionality, cost, trust and control were investigated. The resulting framework is presented to support future co-design of sensors and robots with older adults."

      "abstract": "Wireless sensor nodes, used in disaster management and industrial applications, typically require high reliability and low energy consumption. This reliability is often hindered due to bursty channel errors in practical wireless systems. The existing retransmission scheme used in IEEE 802.15.4 fails to capture the characteristics of burst channels as they are designed under the assumption of uniform error channels. Thus, they do not significantly improve the reliability under bursty channels while increasing the energy consumption with multiple retransmissions. Our proposed method utilises Reinforcement Learning (RL) to develop an adaptive retransmission strategy. This strategy is informed by analysing the transmission history of the sensor. The RL algorithm learns the optimal policy, which maximises energy efficiency and Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) in networks with burst channel errors. Our RL retransmission strategy performed better in PDR and energy efficiency than the IEEE 802.15.4 and\nRetransmission Adaptive Intelligence Medium Access Control (RAI-MAC) proposed in the literature. By adaptively modifying the retransmission strategy, we improved the energy efficiency and PDR by 16% and 10%, respectively, under a 10-15% packet error rate. The results highlight the importance of an adaptive retransmission strategy for resource-constrained wireless sensors."

This is interesting because while there were many operations to create infinitely many new multistationary networks from a multistationary example, this is the first such operation for the non-multistationary counterpart.\n\nSuch tools for the generation of example networks have a use-case in the application of data science to reaction network theory. We demonstrate this by using new data, along with a novel graph representation of reaction networks that is unique up to a permutation on the name of species of the network, to train a graph attention neural network model to predict multistationarity of reaction networks. This is the first time machine learning tools are used for studying classification problems of reaction networks."

The ultimate purpose of the approach presented in this paper is towards the construction of hierarchical attack models based on a set of text descriptions characterising potential or observed vulnerabilities in a given system. Due to the nature of the data, and the uncertainty sensitive environment in which the problem is presented, a practically oriented soft computing approach is necessary. Therefore, a key focus of this work is to investigate practical questions surrounding the reliability of predicted links towards the construction of such models, to which end conceptual and practical challenges and solutions associated with the proposed approach are outlined, such as dataset complexity and stability of predictions. Accordingly, the contributions of this paper focus on training neural networks using a pre-trained language model for predicting sibling relationships between cybersecurity vulnerabilities, then outlining how to apply this predictive model towards the generation of hierarchical attack models. In addition, two data sampling mechanisms for tackling data complexity and a consensus mechanism for reducing the amount of false positive predictions are outlined. Each of these approaches is compared and contrasted using empirical results from three sets of cybersecurity data to determine their effectiveness."

      "abstract": "Social media has become central to contemporary activism, transforming how movements worldwide mobilise and organise around shared goals. The #EndSARS movement in Nigeria started in 2017 as a citizen-led effort that confronted police brutality, especially from the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) of the Nigerian Police. Facilitated primarily by social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, data shows that more than 8 million unique authors participated in creating content that commented on or provided support to the offline protests (NENDO 2020). Much like other contemporary social media activism efforts, #EndSARS lacked established and movement-recognised spokespersons; instead, networked microcelebrities and influential voices emerged intermittently, each with varied social capital, reflecting the movement's decentralised nature. This paper presents research into the lived experiences of #EndSARS activists on Instagram, utilising a modified social network analysis to identify these individuals without relying on popularity metrics alone. Adopting a postcolonial lens, this research centred on inclusive representation to disrupt traditional hierarchies where dominant voices speak over, or on behalf of, marginalised communities. This approach was implemented through Richardson's (2000) crystallisation and by operationalising Tufekci's (2013) concept of the \"networked microcelebrity\". Standard social network analysis metrics were adapted to recognise diverse voices and multifaceted connections among activists. The resulting visualisation platform highlights interactions among 117 information-rich participants, offering multidirectional perspectives on the movement's narrative. This approach enhanced the visibility of less-prominent activists and provided a nuanced, visually engaging map of the networked narratives driving #EndSARS. In a broader context, this approach initiates the conversation on decolonising social network analysis to incorporate more diverse and representative voices."

To ensure safe and efficient operation, a novel, robust and adaptive control strategy is employed using a two-stage recursive least squares based estimation, combined with an auto-tuning mixed-sensitivity H∞ controller. A numerical simulation demonstrates fast and accurate real-time estimation of actuator loss of effectiveness and changes in the mass and inertia due to payload pickup/drop-off during delivery missions. The combined and uneven effects of multiple faults with initial mass and inertia uncertainties are efficiently compensated by this novel fault tolerant flight control strategy. The controller also improves the rejection of these uncertainties during the transient stage before the convergence of the parameter estimation. The proposed approach maintains the operational reliability of delivery quadcopters under a range of challenging uneven faults and significant mass and inertia uncertainties."

To achieve this, several tools, leveraging constraint-based stoichiometric models and metaheuristic algorithms like particle swarm optimization (PSO), have been developed. However, PSO can potentially get trapped in local optima. Quantum-behaved PSO (QPSO) overcomes this limitation, and our study further enhances its binary version (BQPSO) with a neighborhood topology, leading to the advanced neighborhood-based BQPSO (NBQPSO). Combined with flux balance analysis (FBA), this forms an innovative approach, NBQPSO-FBA, for identifying optimal knockout strategies to maximize the desired metabolite production. Additionally, we introduced a novel encoding strategy suitable for large-scale genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs). Evaluated on four E. coli GSMMs (iJR904, iAF1260, iJO1366, and iML1515), NBQPSO-FBA matches or surpasses established bi-level linear programming (LP) and heuristic methods in metabolite production optimization. Notably, it achieved 90.69% realization of the theoretical maximum in acetate production and demonstrated comparable performance with leading algorithms in lactate production. The efficiency of NBQPSO-FBA, which requires fewer knockouts, makes it a practical and effective tool for optimizing microbial cell factories. This addresses the rising demand for microbial products across various industries."

      "abstract": "Evaluating deep squats accurately during automatic physical rehabilitation monitoring across different subjects remains challenging due to inter-subject variability and limited labelled data. The challenges include: 1) conventional methods presuppose that a \"one-model-fits-all\"approach works for activity evaluation, ignoring that subject-specific differences can lead to suboptimal results if these differences are not considered. 2) Previous studies focus on offline learning, where models are trained on the entire dataset, which can be updated later through retraining. This approach neglects the need for continual learning, where models adapt sequentially to new subjects while retaining past knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a novel continual meta-learning approach and a memory buffer to provide personalized deep squat evaluations. Using Azure Kinect sensors, we collected RGB-D videos and 3D skeletal data from 33 participants performing deep squats, annotated with Functional Movement Screen (FMS) scores. Our model dynamically adapts to new participants while retaining knowledge from previous ones, preventing performance degradation over time. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms a model without a buffer memory technique by retaining learned knowledge across participants and adapting to new individuals with minimal data."

Despite substantial progress, the practical application of e‐textiles in wearable technologies remains limited by challenging tasks of integrating both optimal electrical performance and thermal‐moisture comfort into a single fabric, particularly at industrial scales. Herein, leveraging a meta‐textile structural design, a smart treble‐weaving electronic textile (TWET) that combines highly sensitive sensing capabilities with radiative cooling is developed and enhanced sweat management through meta‐yarn junction blocks forming hierarchical fabric architectures. Unlike conventional layered fabrics by simply compositing different functional layers, the TWET fabric integrates multimodal sensing, optical and moisture management into an all‐in‐one construction and leverages its interlacing structures as conduits for heat and moisture transmission, which contributes to outstanding thermal‐moisture comfort. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the TWET performs robust monitoring and perception of human motion signals against heat stress. It is also shown that frequency‐domain signals resulting from Fourier transformation can interpret and distinguish temporal‐spatial features of regulating walking and stepping in place. This meta‐textile hierarchical‐assembly concept enables integrated thermal and moisture management in next‐generation e‐textiles, offering great potential for scalable production and multifunctionality through the precise engineering of meta‐structures."

Our research focuses on gender bias in Nepali-English machine translation, an area that has seen little exploration. With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLM), there is a unique opportunity to mitigate these biases. In this study, we quantify and evaluate gender bias by constructing an occupation corpus and adapting three gender-bias challenge sets for Nepali. Our findings reveal that gender bias is prevalent in existing translation systems, with translations often reinforcing stereotypes and misrepresenting gender-specific roles. However, LLMs perform significantly better in both gender-neutral and gender-specific contexts, demonstrating less bias compared to traditional machine translation systems. Despite some quirks, LLMs offer a promising alternative for culture-rich, low-resource languages like Nepali. We also explore how LLMs can improve gender accuracy and mitigate biases in occupational terms, providing a more equitable translation experience. Our work contributes to the growing effort to reduce biases in machine translation and highlights the potential of LLMs to address bias in low-resource languages, paving the way for more inclusive and accurate translation systems."
