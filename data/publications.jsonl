The competitive world of social networks and the variety of services they provide have persuaded users to apply for the membership of several networks. This situation makes involvement of the shared individuals across multiple social networks essential for the effective dissemination of information. In this paper, we introduce a community-based entropic method to identify influential nodes in multiple social networks, taking into account the effect of shared users. The proposed method, titled IM2-SE, focuses on calculating a total structural entropy for each node. This structural entropy is defined as the weighted sum of the structural entropies of the node in the networks and in the communities, it belongs to. The structural entropy of a node is based on Tsallis entropy considering both local and global structures of the network, and it utilizes the degree of centrality and betweenness centrality. Then, the nodes with the highest total structural entropy are identified as the influential nodes. The empirical evaluation of the proposed method on the real-world datasets including homogeneous and heterogeneous networks, demonstrates its superior performance to the baseline methods. Furthermore, the impact of the shared nodes between networks in identifying the influential nodes has been examined, revealing that up to 50% of the identified influential nodes are the shared nodes between specific networks.", "source_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/a-communitybased-entropic-method-to-identify-influential-nodes-ac/"}

In this study, we develop a novel hybrid approach to modelling and forecasting the dynamics and the demand for healthcare resources. We take advantage of the concept of PINNs to capture the dynamics of infectious diseases, estimate key parameters, and unobserved states in the ability of the model, using the neural network to integrate physical laws directly into the learning process of a modified compartmental model. We also make use of the strength of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to combine data generated by a PINN and lagged covariates of target variables to forecast demand from the intensive care unit demand using different variations of RNN models.

Like the ants, the demand agents will release pheromones on the resource agent to indicate the available resources. The next arriving demand agent will most probably choose a neighbor, following the pheromone value and communication cost. The framework’s performance is evaluated in terms of local resource utilization, dependency on fog and cloud, and communication cost.

This research addresses how the distributed generation location and capacity impact the operation of the circuit breaker in terms of the response time of the circuit breakers. The relative electrical distances of the faults and distributed generation to the circuit breakers are considered. The impact of distributed generation capacity considering the fault location is characterized using a new index called the heterogeneity index. The electrical distance between distributed generations and circuit breakers and the electrical distance between fault and circuit breaker is considered by a second new index called the electrical distance ratio. Data analysis on simulation results shows that these indices capture the phenomena of protection blinding caused by distributed generation. Results show that a higher distributed generation penetration and faults that are electrically further away from a circuit breaker show severe cases of protection blinding captured by the indices. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how these indices can identify the worst impacted locations in the distribution grid. A key result is that protection blinding does not necessarily occur solely due to the presence of distributed generation between a circuit breaker and a fault, but is dependent on factors such as distributed generation location in the distribution grid, fault level, fault level distribution across the generation units and fault location.", "source_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/analysis-of-protection-blinding-in-active-distribution-grids/"}

The progression of this condition is intricately linked to hemodynamic factors such as wall shear stress (WSS) and von Mises stress, as abnormal distributions can contribute to thrombus formation, endothelial damage, and the worsening of aneurysmal conditions. In this study, six vascular models were analyzed: four representing diseased aortas with Marfan syndrome aneurysms and two healthy aortic models for comparison. The models were sourced from Vascular Model Repository, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted using a Newtonian fluid model and the shear stress transport (SST) k- ω turbulent transitional model to evaluate WSS and von Mises stress. Fluid-structure interaction was employed to incorporate vessel wall interaction, and pulsatile inlet velocity profiles were used to simulate physiological blood flow, capturing time-dependent hemodynamic variations. The results revealed significant differences between healthy and diseased aortic models. In healthy models, WSS was uniformly distributed, with values consistently below 40 Pa, reflecting stable vascular conditions. Conversely, the diseased models exhibited highly non-uniform WSS distributions, with notably lower values in aneurysmal regions, contributing to thrombus formation, with elevated WSS in areas like the carotid and subclavian arteries due to geometric and hemodynamic complexities. The von Mises stress analysis identified regions of heightened rupture risk, particularly on the superior side of case MS 1 , where both von Mises stress and WSS reached their highest values among all cases. Physics-informed neural networks demonstrated strong agreement with CFD results while significantly reducing computational cost, highlighting their potential for real-time clinical applications. These findings underscore the critical role of hemodynamic factors in aneurysm progression and rupture risk, offering valuable insights for optimizing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in vascular diseases.", "source_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/fluidstructure-interaction-analysis-of-pulsatile-flow-in-arterial/"}

Previous research tackled this task via a two-step approach, which first predicts separately the emotion and cause clauses, and then pairs them up by using a binary classifier. However, such a two-step approach may suffer from the possible propagation of errors, and it neglects the interaction between emotions and causes. In this article, an end-to-end double-graph method with relational enhancement (DGRE) is proposed to stimulate two relationship modes among clauses, i.e., semantic dependence and logical dependence. First, two united graph encoders are established to embed the semantic dependence into the representation of clauses and pairs. The first encoder is built on graph attention networks (GATs) for clause-level representation, the result of which is used by a relational graph convolutional network (RGCN) for the refinement of pair-level representation. Aiming to enhance the fitting ability of logical dependence, the emotion-type classification task is introduced into the multitask learning framework of GATs, which can effectively distinguish the logical relations between clauses according to their emotion types. Moreover, seven types of dependence relations have been designed for the node connections in RGCN, which emphasize the contextual interaction and clustering among neighboring nodes. Experiments on a benchmark Chinese corpus demonstrate that the proposed DGRE approach could effectively establish the communication mechanism between clauses and pairs from multiple perspectives, and comparisons with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models well validate its effectiveness.", "source_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/double-graph-representation-with-relational-enhancement-for-emoti/"}

This study presents a systematic literature review examining how human-in-the-loop explainable AI (HITL-XAI) approaches can enhance the effectiveness and adoption of AI systems in PdM contexts.

Traditional numerical models struggle in such settings due to high computational cost, the need for extensive mesh generation, and difficulties in assimilating heterogeneous data sources. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a hybrid Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) framework that integrates governing physical laws, satellite-derived vegetation data, and outputs from high- resolution Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of the Sundarbans mangrove system. The proposed hybrid PINN model incorporates shallow water flow and sediment transport equations into the loss function and uses a temporal causality weighting mechanism to improve convergence in time-dependent domains. Model outputs include elevation, flow velocity, and suspended sediment concentration. The model is trained using a small subset of CFD simulation data and validated against a traditional finite element (FE) solver and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) baseline. The proposed hybrid PINNs model achieved RMSE values in the range of 10 −2 for elevation and velocity and 10 −3 for sediment concentration, significantly outperforming the CNN model, particularly in generalising to unseen time steps. Compared to the FE model, the proposed framework achieved a five-fold reduction in training time (24 h vs. 5 days) and supports inference within seconds, enabling near real-time predictions. The mesh-free structure of the model, combined with its physics-regularised learning, also facilitates adaptation to other coastal or mangrove systems governed by similar dynamics. This hybrid approach offers a robust, generalisable surrogate for high-fidelity coastal simulations in data-scarce and computationally demanding environments.", "source_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/leveraging-physics-informed-neural-networks-for-efficient-modelli/"}

This study examines the alteration of brain activity caused by dementia by analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals using an infor- mation geometry method known as information rate, which captures the evolving pat- terns of brain signals over time rather than relying on static averages. This method is applied across standard EEG frequency bands – delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma – in participants with dementia and healthy controls. The characteristics of the distribu- tion of information rate are studied through the statistical moments (such as mean, vari- ance, skewness, and kurtosis) and Shannon entropy. The statistical comparisons are accessed using the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post-hoc analysis, and results are compared against a conventional average-base method using Jensen-Shannon distance. The results show that dynamic features of EEG signals – particularly in the theta, alpha, and beta bands – effectively distinguish Alzheimer’s patients from healthy individuals, while the Shannon entropy of signal dynamics in frontal region differentiates frontotem- poral dementia patients across the theta to gamma bands. Moreover, changes in the occipital region detected by information rate, but not by traditional method, further high- light the importance of capturing temporal variability. The method also successfully dis- tinguishes individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment from healthy controls, which con- ventional analysis failed to achieve. These results suggest that analyzing the dynamics properties of the brain signals provides a more sensitive and informative approach for identifying and distinguishing various forms of dementia.", "source_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/evaluating-brain-electroencephalogram-signal-dynamics-across-cogn/"}

A promising candidate in this regard is electroencephalography (EEG), as it is one of the most economic imaging modalities. Recent efforts in EEG analysis have shifted towards leveraging spatial information, employing novel frameworks such as graph signal processing or graph neural networks. Here, we investigate the importance of spatial information relative to spectral or temporal information by varying the proportion of each dimension for AD classification. To do so, we systematically test various dimension resolution configurations on two routine EEG datasets. Our findings show that spatial information is more important than temporal information and equally valuable as spectral information. On the larger second dataset, substituting spectral with spatial information even led to an increase of 1.1% in accuracy, which emphasises the importance of spatial information for EEG-based AD classification. We argue that our resolution-based feature extraction has the potential to improve AD classification specifically, and multivariate signal classification generally.Clinical relevance - This study proposes balancing the spectral, temporal and spatial feature resolution to improve EEGbased diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases.", "source_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/balancing-spectral-temporal-and-spatial-information-for-eeg-based/"}

However, poor quality of clinical information in digital health technologies (DHTs) can compromise the quality and safety of care. The Clinical Information Quality (CLIQ) framework was developed, based on a systemic review of literature and an international eDelphi study, as a tool to assess the quality of clinical information in DHTs. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to assess the applicability, internal consistency, and construct validity of the CLIQ framework. METHODS: This study was conducted as a cross-sectional survey of health care professionals across the United Kingdom who regularly use SystmOne electronic health records. Participants were invited through emails and social media platforms. The CLIQ questionnaire was administered as a web-based survey. Spearman correlation coefficients were computed to investigate the linear relationship between the dimensions in the CLIQ framework. The Cronbach α coefficients were computed to assess the internal consistency of the global scale (ie, CLIQ framework) and the subscales (ie, the informativeness, availability, and usability categories). Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess the extent to which the survey data supported the construct validity of the CLIQ framework. RESULTS: A total of 109 health care professionals completed the survey, of which two-thirds (67, 61.5%) were doctors and a quarter (26, 23.9%) were nurses or advanced nurse practitioners. Overall, the CLIQ dimensions had good quality scores except for portability, which had a modest score. The inter-item correlations were all positive and not likely due to chance. The Cronbach α coefficient for the overall CLIQ framework was 0.89 (95% CI 0.85-0.92). The confirmatory factor analysis provided a modest support for the construct validity of the CLIQ framework with the comparative fit index of 0.86 and standardized root mean square residual of 0.08. CONCLUSIONS: The CLIQ framework demonstrated a high reliability and a modest construct validity. The CLIQ framework offers a pragmatic approach to assessing the quality of clinical information in DHTs and could be applied as part of information quality assurance systems in health care settings to improve quality of health information.", "source_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/a-novel-framework-to-assess-clinical-information-in-digital-healt/"}

The UK Rare Diseases Framework and its England Rare Diseases Action Plans aim to improve the lives of people with lived experience of rare diseases and their carers. Reaching these goals requires more effective engagement with those least likely to interact with NHS services. This paper outlines a protocol to identify relevant high-level policy metrics while engaging underserved and underrepresented groups. Methods and Analysis: A long list of candidate metrics for the 36 Actions linked to the four Priority Areas of the Framework was compiled from government logic models. The list was discussed in three workshops, and irrelevant, ambiguous, or time-irrelevant metrics were removed. Additional metrics were identified through an evidence review and expert opinion. In the first round of a two-round eDelphi study, shortlisted metrics will be grouped into the four Priority Areas: Faster Diagnosis, Increased Healthcare Professional Awareness, Better Care Coordination, and Improved Access to Specialist Care, Treatment, and drugs. An eDelphi panel of 50 people living with rare disease or their carers, as well as 50 professional stakeholders, will rate each metric on a 1-9 scale. The sample size allows for 20% attrition. Consensus for inclusion or exclusion will be based on 70% agreement (7-9 for 'very valuable', 1-3 for 'not valuable'), with fewer than 15% rating the metric at the opposite end of the scale. Metrics will be included or excluded if consensus is reached in both groups; otherwise, they will remain under consideration in Round 2. In Round 1, eDelphi participants may propose additional metrics, which will be included in Round 2. After two rounds, a final set of policy metrics will be selected. Any discrepancies in Round 2 ratings will be explored through further research. Ethics and Dissemination: The Coventry University Group Research Ethics Committee has approved the study (P183377). The results will be disseminated to people with lived experience of rare disease and professional stakeholders through conferences, events, and newsletters and submitted to a peer-reviewed journal. If adopted, the identified metrics will inform decision-making on rare disease policies in England and beyond.

We co-created a theory-led, evidence-based, 6-week, digital self-management and positive wellbeing intervention (Hope PCOS), delivered to UK adults.  We tested the intervention’s potential to improve mental health and wellbeing outcomes and its acceptability and usability for adults living with PCOS. Methods: This was a mixed methods feasibility randomised controlled trial conducted online, with a pre-post, waitlist-controlled design. Primary outcomes were recruitment, completion (≥ 3 intervention sessions) and follow-up rates. At baseline, participants reported demographic information, PCOS symptoms, depression (Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)), anxiety ((Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7)), polycystic ovary syndrome health-related quality of life (PCOSQ-50), psychological wellbeing (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, WEMWBS) and self-efficacy (Self-Efficacy to Manage Chronic Disease Scale (SEMCD6)) before randomisation to an intervention group (IG) receiving the intervention immediately or a waitlist control group (CG) receiving the intervention 12 weeks later. PHQ-9, GAD-7, PCOSQ-50, WEMWBS and SEMDC6 were reassessed at 6 and 12 weeks. IG participants reported the usability of the digital intervention (system usability scale (SUS)) and acceptability via qualitative exit interviews. Results: Of 131 eligible, consented participants, 83% (N=109, age M=37.1, SD=8.6 years) completed baseline measures and were randomised to the IG (n=54) or the CG (n=55). Baseline clinical caseness was high for depression (n=77, 70.6%) and anxiety (n=78, 71.6 %). Twenty-one participants (39%) in the IG completed ≥3 intervention sessions. At 6-week follow-up, completion of secondary outcomes was n=32 (59%) for IG and n= 38 (69%) for CG; at 12 weeks, n=31 (57%) for IG and n= 38 (69%) for CG. Twelve IG participants took part in the exit interviews. Exploratory descriptive statistics suggest there were greater improvements in depression, anxiety, psychological wellbeing, self-efficacy and quality of life for the intervention group completers compared to the waitlist control group. SUS data and thematic analysis suggest the intervention was usable, acceptable, relevant and interesting. Participants reported experiences including feeling seen and valued, having the difficulties of lifestyle change acknowledged, and learning valuable lessons, particularly how to monitor and manage emotions, prioritise self-care and complete personal goals. Conclusions:  This novel intervention was rated as usable and acceptable, with potential for improving mental health and wellbeing outcomes. More research is needed to identify for whom the intervention is beneficial and on implementation in practice.", "source_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/a-feasibility-trial-of-a-co-created-digital-self-management-progr/"}

These topics are at the heart of symbolic computation and were first implemented in computer algebra systems decades ago, but have recently received renewed interest as part of the ongoing development of SMT solvers for non-linear real arithmetic. First, we consider the use of iterated univariate resultants in traditional CAD, and how this leads to inefficiencies, especially in the case of an input with multiple equational constraints.   We reproduce the workshop paper [Davenport & England, 2023], adding important clarifications to our suggestions first made there to make use of multivariate resultants in the projection phase of CAD.  We then consider an alternative approach to this problem first documented in [McCallum & Brown, 2009] which redefines the actual object under construction, albeit only in the case of two equational constraints.  We correct an unhelpful typo and provide a proof missing from that paper. We finish by revising the topic of how to deal with SMT or Real QE problems expressed using rational functions (as opposed to the usual polynomial ones) noting that these are often found in industrial applications.  We revisit a proposal made in [Uncu, Davenport and England, 2023] for doing this in the case of satisfiability, explaining why such an approach does not trivially extend to more complicated quantification structure and giving a suitable alternative.", "source_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/iterated-resultants-and-rational-functions-in-real-quantifier-eli/"}

Despite widespread hierarchical approaches, empirical evidence comparing these strategies remains limited. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of both paradigms using reinforcement learning (RL) with the Building Optimization Performance Test (BOPTEST) framework. We implement and compare: (1) setpoint-trained RL agents using PPO, DQN, and A2C algorithms, (2) direct actuation-controlled RL agents with identical algorithms, and (3) a conventional PI controller baseline. Experiments span two simulation environments (BESTEST Hydronic Heat Pump and BESTEST Air systems) with constant electricity pricing. Results demonstrate that setpoint regulation achieves near-perfect thermal comfort (> 99% discomfort reduction) with modest energy cost increases (4.8–5.0%), while direct actuator control offers smaller energy penalties (1.8–3.2%) with substantial comfort improvements (> 80% discomfort reduction). Most significantly, setpoint regulation consistently demonstrated faster learning, requiring 48–79% fewer training steps across algorithms and environments. The setpoint-trained approach also exhibited 38% lower control signal variance (measured as the standard deviation of actuator commands) over the 14-day testing period. These findings provide quantitative evidence supporting a two-level control architecture, where an RL agent optimizes setpoints for existing low-level controllers, while also identifying conditions where direct actuator control by an RL agent may be advantageous. Our research contributes valuable empirical insights for designing energy-efficient building control strategies using reinforcement learning, with setpoint regulation offering significant advantages in training efficiency and control stability.", "source_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/reinforcement-learning-for-building-control-direct-actuator-or-pi/"}

Methods: We employ LLM to prioritize candidate studies by aligning abstracts with the selection criteria outlined in an SR protocol. Abstract screening was transformed into a novel question-answering (QA) framework, treating each selection criterion as a question addressed by LLM. The framework involves breaking down the selection criteria into multiple questions, properly prompting LLM to answer each question, scoring and re-ranking each answer, and combining the responses to make nuanced inclusion or exclusion decisions. Results and Discussion: Large-scale validation was performed on the benchmark of CLEF eHealth 2019 Task 2: Technology-Assisted Reviews in Empirical Medicine. Focusing on GPT-3.5 as a case study, the proposed QA framework consistently exhibited a clear advantage over traditional information retrieval approaches and bespoke BERT-family models that were fine-tuned for prioritizing candidate studies (ie, from the BERT to PubMedBERT) across 31 datasets of 4 categories of SRs, underscoring their high potential in facilitating abstract screening. The experiments also showcased the viability of using selection criteria as a query for reference prioritization. The experiments also showcased the viability of the framework using different LLMs. Conclusion: Investigation justified the indispensable value of leveraging selection criteria to improve the performance of automated abstract screening. LLMs demonstrated proficiency in prioritizing candidate studies for abstract screening using the proposed QA framework.

However, regional efforts, considering historical emissions, remain underexplored. Here, we assess energy system changes, technology adoption, and investments needed for developing regions, including five major- and minor-emitting nations. Our analysis, using an integrated assessment model, shows a large gap in regional efforts toward global net-zero emissions, stemming from the necessary shift of energy systems to low-carbon resources. The use of new technologies, like electric vehicles, hydrogen, and carbon capture, varies by region, with the highest adoption required between 2020 and 2030. Financing this shift needs an average gross domestic product (GDP) investment rise of 0.464% in minor-emitting regions and up to 2.1% in major-emitting regions by 2085. Our results could guide policies and support setting quantifiable targets for developing nations. The findings are key to facilitating strategic technology use and finance mobilization to achieve a carbon-neutral future.", "source_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/roadmap-to-reach-global-net-zero-emissions-for-developing-regions/"}

However, micro-grid solutions are often inflexible and lack functionality to respond to displaced community energy needs and ensure the long-term sustainability of interventions. This paper explores the use of fog-computing retrofit architectures deployed on community micro-grid infrastructures to enable flexible demand management to improve service delivery and longevity. A micro-services solution is proposed that decouples components increasing resilience and testability while allowing hybrid edge-cloud deployments. The architecture is outlined and demonstrated for a micro-grid providing energy to two nurseries and a playground in Kigeme refugee camp, Rwanda. To enact the community priorities within the demand management system, modified Genetic Algorithm (GA) methods are outlined and tested for different use-case scenarios. The performance of the modified GA methods are then compared with a pre-existing battery protect controller and an alternative deterministic (space-shared) energy manager model. A modified search space GA method was required for GA to outperform both the existing battery controller and proposed deterministic method in terms of achieving the highest utility function in almost every use-case. The results further showed how simple community priorities can be set and used to enact control on the system in 24h timeframes that are in line with the local decision-making context.", "source_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/a-community-energy-management-system-for-smart-microgrids/"}

This article examines the reasons for the lack of Muslim-heritage adopters or foster carers in the UK by combining understandings from Islamic religious texts, contemporary British social work practice, and sociological analysis of children's experiences. The empirical findings presented here are based on semi-structured qualitative interviews (n = 41) with various professionals and carers involved in the care of Muslim-heritage children. Our evidence uncovers specific socio-cultural, political and theological barriers that hinder carers of Muslim backgrounds from coming forward to adopt or foster. By better understanding these barriers, this article provides an evidence base to inform social work policy and practice to enhance recruitment of carers from Muslim backgrounds.

This limitation is further augmented in energy systems by the complexity of systems composition and systems operation for energy generation, distribution, and supply. The primary reason for this limitation is the gap between the conceptual notion of ethics principles and the technical performance of AI applications in energy systems. For instance, trust is featured prominently in ethics frameworks but pertains to limited relevance for the robust operation of a smart grid. In this paper, we propose a lifecycle approach for AI ethics that aims to address this gap. The proposed approach consists of four phases: design, development, operation, and evaluation. All four phases are supported by a central AI ethics repository that gathers and integrates the primary and secondary dimensions of ethical practice, including reliability, safety, and trustworthiness, from design through to evaluation. This lifecycle approach is closely aligned with the operational lifecycle of energy systems, from design and production through to use, maintenance, repair, and overhaul, followed by shutdown, recycling, and replacement. Across these lifecycle stages, an energy system engages with numerous human stakeholders, directly with designers, engineers, users, trainers, operators, and maintenance technicians, as well as indirectly with managers, owners, policymakers, and community groups. This lifecycle approach is empirically evaluated in the complex energy system of a multi-campus tertiary education institution where the alignment between ethics and technical performance, as well as the human-centric application of AI, are demonstrated.", "source_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/a-lifecycle-approach-for-artificial-intelligence-ethics-in-energy/"}

Through their narratives, we understand how children in care experience and perceive their identities, as well as their understandings of the care that they receive and desire for their identities. We rely on children’s and young people’s voices and stories. Using an intersectional approach, we worked with Black, Asian and mixed-heritage children and young people (aged 14 to 19) to understand their narratives of identity. We focused firstly on understandings of ethnicity and religion and how these change in relation to other aspects of identity and, crucially, by being in care. Secondly, we examined their experiences of asking and getting help from social workers, foster carers, adopters and other support structures that provide for their identities while in care. By listening to and understanding children and young people’s perspectives around ethnicity, religion and identity, we developed a new framework to inform both theoretical and practical work with children in care. We describe our model as Identities in-Flux, which integrates Kimberlé Crenshaw’s Intersectionality and Meredith McGuires’ Lived Religion theories to generate new frameworks of reference that support best practice when implementing support plans for young people and children. Within this model, we consider the interplay of changing socio-ethnic-religious factors, as well as young people and children’s biological heritage, their being in care and their own agency in determining how they themselves want to be perceived. By broadening discussion from a singular focus on one aspect of identity, such as race or gender, we hope to support inclusive and sensitive practices and policies that reflect and respond to the increasing diversity of children and young people entering care.", "source_url": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/expressions-of-self-race-religion-and-representation-of-minoritis/"}

Using the case of the design and deployment of 20 stove use monitors (SUM) in Kigeme refugee camp in Rwanda, this paper discusses the benefits and limitations of collecting data on cookstove usage using wireless sensors in refugee settlements., Central to the discussion is the value of reflexivity or critical reflection to uncover significant knowledge gaps that can apply more generally to the problem of designing and deploying sensor systems for the displaced setting. If sensor monitoring systems are to collect data that aid appropriate energy planning and support technology development in the humanitarian sector, we contend improvements in sensor design and deployment protocols are needed to accommodate the displaced setting's cultural, economic, and political complexity. These improvements include the uptake of sensor monitoring design that embeds ethical, progressive, and inclusive protocols when working in the displaced setting."}

However, the main disadvantage of fluoroscopic imaging is the lack of soft tissue information and harmful radiation. In contrast, ultrasound (US) has the advantages of low-cost, non-radiation, and high contrast in soft tissue. In this paper we propose a framework to extract the catheter from both X-ray and US images in real time for cardiac interventions. The catheter extraction from X-ray images is based on SURF features, local patch analysis and Kalman filtering to acquire a set of sorted key points representing the catheter. At the same time, the transformation between the X-ray and US images can be obtained via 2D/3D rigid registration between a 3D model of the US probe and its projection on X-ray images. By backprojecting the information about the catheter location in the X-ray images to the US images the search space can be drastically reduced. The extraction of the catheter from US is based on 3D SURF feature clusters, graph model building, A* algorithm and B-spline smoothing. Experiments show the overall process can be achieved in 2.72 seconds for one frame and the reprojected error is 1.99 mm on average."}

In some cases, they may never find a permanent home at all. Such delays cause lasting harm for children and according to Selwyn et al, ‘delay in decision making and action has an unacceptable price in terms of the reduction in children’s life chances and the financial costs to local authorities, the emotional and financial burden later placed on adoptive families and future costs to society’ (2006). Policy makers’ response has been to emphasise transracial placements so that the process of finding a permanent home is expedited for these children.\n\nThrough interviews with social workers, foster carers, adoptive parents and prospective adoptive parents, this research presents a research-informed narrative of the complexities in Muslim children’s circumstances and identities, which influence how decisions are made about their lives. By better understanding the journeys of these children through the care system, this research will provide an evidence base for practitioners, policy makers and communities to draw upon, and in doing so will improve outcomes for these children, their families and for society as a whole.\n\nThis research provides strong evidence of the salience of Islam to Muslim children’s identities. When children come into care they experience upheaval, displacement and trauma – in such contexts faith is familiar and enables children to be resilient. If in their new home, children’s faith and ethnic needs are provided, they are happier, are more settled and attach better and sooner to their carers. Foster carers and adopters agree that faith is central to their identities too, that faith motivates them to care for the children they look after and that they may be best placed to meet the needs of children who come from ethnic and religious backgrounds similar to their own. For adopters there was an additional emphasis on the child they adopted ‘looking like them’.\n\nBased on this key finding of the salience of religion to the formation, evolution and preservation of the identities of children in public care, we suggest 7 inter-related recommendations for policy makers, social workers, carers and for the Muslim community to take forward. We do not assign a particular recommendation to a particular group, instead we call for joined-up thinking and collective action from these stakeholders, aimed at prioritising each child’s welfare, security and happiness.\n\nAs a final word we emphasise the good practice that we can evidence in how social workers address the faith needs of Muslim children. The story is by no means only about good practice. Indeed, we have found evidence of blind-spots and lacunae. Nevertheless for a profession that faces regular unfair coverage from the media, it is important to emphasise the strengths of the profession and the conscientious care it provides to the most vulnerable children in our societies. Our intention with this report, is to celebrate and share the good practice and where there are blind-spots to engage critically but also collegially to fill the gaps in provision.\n\nThe seven recommendations we make on the basis of this project are as follows:\n\nRecommendation 1: Include religion in SSDA903 returns and the national DfE database on looked after children\n\nRecommendation 2: Recognise the salience of faith in children’s journeys through the care system and enhance the faith literacy of social work practitioners and policy makers.\n\nRecommendation 3: Develop and disseminate Islamic theological guidance on adoption and fostering that prioritises the children’s needs.\n\nRecommendation 4: Where required adoptive parents need be offered theological advice on the issue of establishing Mahram relations with their adopted children. If they choose to lactate their children they should be offered medical support\n\nRecommendation 5: The agreements between Islamic modesty guidelines and safeguarding policy need to be shared with Muslim foster carers.\n\nRecommendation 6: In line with the recommendation of the Education Select Committee, more outreach, information and recruitment work needs to be undertaken with diverse British Muslim communities to increase the number of Muslim foster carers and adopters.\n\nRecommendation 7: Need to evaluate the impact of the removal of ethnicity from adoption law and guidance in England on practice."}

The no free lunch theorem implies that no optimisation algorithm fits all problems; therefore, the interest is not only in the accuracy and convergence rate of the algorithm but also the tuning effort and population size required for achieving the optimal result. The latter is particularly crucial for computationally intensive or high-dimensional problems. Contrast-based Fruit-fly Optimisation Algorithm (c-FOA) proposed by Kanarachos et al. in 2017 is based on the efficiency of fruit flies in food foraging by olfaction and visual contrast. The proposed Spontaneous Fruit Fly Optimisation (s-FOA) enhances c-FOA and addresses the difficulty in solving nonlinear optimisation algorithms by presenting standard parameters and lean population size for use on all optimisation problems. Six benchmark problems were studied to assess the performance of s-FOA. A comparison of the results obtained from documented literature and other investigated techniques demonstrates the competence and robustness of the algorithm in truss optimisation."}

Commercial GNSS receivers usually sample at 1 Hz, which is not sufficient to robustly and accurately track a vehicle in certain scenarios, such as driving on the highway, where the vehicle could travel at medium to high speeds, or in safety-critical scenarios. In addition, the GNSS relies on a number of satellites to perform triangulation and may experience signal loss around tall buildings, bridges, tunnels and trees. An approach to overcoming this problem involves integrating the GNSS with a vehicle-mounted Inertial Navigation Sensor (INS) system to provide a continuous and more reliable high rate positioning solution. INSs are however plagued by unbounded exponential error drifts during the double integration of the acceleration to displacement. Several deep learning algorithms have been employed to learn the error drift for a better positioning prediction. We therefore investigate in this chapter the performance of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Input Delay Neural Network (IDNN), Multi-Layer Neural Network (MLNN) and Kalman Filter (KF) for high data rate positioning. We show that Deep Neural Network-based solutions can exhibit better performances for high data rate positioning of vehicles in comparison to commonly used approaches like the Kalman filter."}

Modeling Insights From High-Risk Women in Sub-Saharan Africa", "year": "2020", "authors": [], "author_urls": [], "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: New HIV infections remain higher in women than men in sub-Saharan Africa. Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective HIV prevention measure, currently prioritized for those at highest risk, such as female sex workers (FSWs), for whom it is most cost-effective. However, the greatest number of HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa occurs in women in the general population. As countries consider wider PrEP scale-up, there is a need to weigh the population-level impact, cost, and relative cost-effectiveness to inform priority setting. METHODS: We developed mathematical models of HIV risk to women and derived tools to highlight key considerations for PrEP programming. The models were fitted to South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Kenya, spanning a range of HIV burden in sub-Saharan Africa. The impact, cost, and cost-effectiveness of PrEP scale-up for adolescent girls and young women (AGYW), women 25 to 34 years old, and women 35 to 49 years old were assessed, accounting for differences in population sizes and the low program retention levels reported in demonstration projects. RESULTS: Preexposure prophylaxis could avert substantially more infections a year among women in general population than among FSW. The greatest number of infections could be averted annually among AGYW in South Africa (24-fold that for FSW). In Zimbabwe, the greatest number of infections could be averted among women 25 to 34 years old (8-fold that for FSW); and in Kenya, similarly between AGYW and women 25 to 34 years old (3-fold that for FSW). However, the unit costs of PrEP delivery for AGYW, women 25 to 34 years old, and women 35 to 49 years old would have to reduce considerably (by 70.8%-91.0% across scenarios) for scale-up to these populations to be as cost-effective as for FSW. CONCLUSIONS: Preexposure prophylaxis has the potential to substantially reduce new HIV infections in HIV-endemic countries in sub-Saharan Africa. This will necessitate PrEP being made widely available beyond those at highest individual risk and continued integration into a range of national services and at community level to significantly bring down the costs and improve cost-effectiveness."}

Results: The I2 test was used to evaluate the heterogeneity of the selected studies, based on the results of I2 test, the prevalence of sleep disturbances in nurses and physicians is I2: 97.4% and I2: 97.3% respectively. After following the systematic review processes, 7 cross-sectional studies were selected for meta-analysis. Six studies with the sample size of 3745 nurses were examined in and the prevalence of sleep disturbances was approximated to be 34.8% (95% CI: 24.8-46.4%). The prevalence of sleep disturbances in physicians was also measured in 5 studies with the sample size of 2123 physicians. According to the results, the prevalence of sleep disturbances in physicians caring for the COVID-19 patients was reported to be 41.6% (95% CI: 27.7-57%). Conclusion: Healthcare workers, as the front line of the fight against COVID-19, are more vulnerable to the harmful effects of this disease than other groups in society. Increasing workplace stress increases sleep disturbances in the medical staff, especially nurses and physicians. In other words, increased stress due to the exposure to COVID-19 increases the prevalence of sleep disturbances in nurses and physicians. Therefore, it is important for health policymakers to provide solutions and interventions to reduce the workplace stress and pressures on medical staff."}

Support vector machines (SVMs) are considered as efficient supervised learning approaches for classification due to their robustness against several types of model misspecifications and outliers. Kernel-based SVMs are known to be more flexible tools for a wide range of supervised learning tasks and can efficiently handle non-linear relationship between input variables and outputs (or labels). They are more robust with respect to the aforementioned model misspecifications, and also more accurate in the sense that the root-mean-square error computed by fitting the kernel-based SVMs is considerably smaller than the one computed by fitting the standard/linear SVMs. However, the choice of kernel type and particularity kernel’s parameters could have significant impact on the classification accuracy and other supervised learning tasks required in network security, Internet of things, cybersecurity, etc. One of the findings of this study is that larger kernel parameter(s) would encourage SVMs with more localities and vice versa. This chapter provides some results on the effect of the kernel parameter on the kernel-based SVM classification. We thus first examine the effect of these parameters on the classification results using the kernel-based SVM, and then specify the optimal value of these parameters using cross-validation (CV) technique."}

A vaccine with 70% efficacy had the capacity to contain COVID-19 outbreak but at very higher vaccination coverage 94.44% (95% Crl 92.44-99.92%) with a vaccine of 100% efficacy requiring 66.10% (95% Crl 64.72-69.95%) coverage. Social distancing measures put in place have so far reduced the number of social contacts by 80.31% (95% Crl 79.76-80.85%). These findings suggest that a highly efficacious vaccine would have been required to contain COVID-19 in South Africa. Therefore, the current social distancing measures to reduce contacts will remain key in controlling the infection in the absence of vaccines and other therapeutics."}

We benefit from the martingale theory and Poisson equations to prove and establish the convergence of the first passage time of reward processes to a zero mean Brownian motion.

Following from this, a family of shadowed κ - μ fading models are introduced and classified according to whether the underlying κ - μ fading undergoes single or double shadowing. In total, we discuss three types of single shadowed κ - μ model (denoted Type I to Type III) and three types of double shadowed κ - μ model (denoted Type I to Type III). The taxonomy of the single shadowed Type I - III models is dependent upon whether the fading model assumes that the dominant component, the scattered waves, or both experience shadowing. Although the physical definition of the examined models make no predetermination of the statistics of the shadowing process, for illustrative purposes, two example cases are provided for each type of single shadowed model by assuming that the shadowing is influenced by either a Nakagami- m random variable (RV) or an inverse Nakagami- m RV. It is worth noting that these RVs have been shown to provide an adequate characterization of shadowing in numerous communication scenarios of practical interest. The categorization of the double shadowed Type I - III models is dependent upon whether a) the envelope experiences shadowing of the dominant component, which is preceded (or succeeded) by a secondary round of (multiplicative) shadowing, or b) the dominant and scattered contributions are fluctuated by two independent shadowing processes, or c) the scattered waves of the envelope are subject to shadowing, which is also preceded (or succeeded) by a secondary round of multiplicative shadowing. Similar to the single shadowed models, we provide two example cases for each type of double shadowed model by assuming that the shadowing phenomena are shaped by a Nakagami- m RV, an inverse Nakagami- m RV or their mixture. It is worth highlighting that the double shadowed κ - μ models offer remarkable flexibility as they include the κ - μ , η - μ , and the various types of single shadowed κ - μ distribution as special cases. This property renders them particularly useful for the effective characterization and modeling of the diverse composite fading conditions encountered in communication scenarios in many emerging wireless applications."}

Simple, static models are user-friendly for policymakers. More complex, dynamic models account for time-dependent changes but are complicated to understand and produce. Under which conditions are static models adequate? We compare static and dynamic model predictions of whether behavioural disinhibition could undermine the impact of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) provision to female sex workers in South Africa.\nMETHODS: A static model of HIV risk was developed and adapted into a dynamic model. Both models were used to estimate the possible reduction in condom use, following PrEP introduction, without increasing HIV risk. The results were compared over a 20-year time horizon, in two contexts: at epidemic equilibrium and during an increasing epidemic.\nRESULTS: Over time horizons of up to 5 years, the models are consistent. Over longer timeframes, the static model overstates the tolerated reduction in condom use where initial condom use is reasonably high ($\\ge$50%) and/or PrEP effectiveness is low ($\\le$45%), especially during an increasing epidemic.\nCONCLUSIONS: Static models can provide useful deductions to guide policymaking around the introduction of a new HIV intervention over short-medium time horizons of up to 5 years. Over longer timeframes, static models may not sufficiently emphasise situations of programmatic importance, especially where underlying epidemics are still increasing."}

The lack of a robust benchmark dataset has thus hindered the advancement in the research, comparison and adoption of deep learning techniques for vehicle positioning based on inertial navigation. In order to facilitate the benchmarking, fast development and evaluation of positioning algorithms, we therefore present the first of its kind large-scale and information-rich inertial and odometry focused public dataset called IO-VNBD (Inertial Odometry Vehicle Navigation Benchmark Dataset).The vehicle tracking dataset was recorded using a research vehicle equipped with ego-motion sensors on public roads in the United Kingdom, Nigeria, and France. The sensors include a GPS receiver, inertial navigation sensors, wheel-speed sensors amongst other sensors found on the car as well as the inertial navigation sensors and GPS receiver in an android smart phone sampling at 10HZ. A diverse number of scenarios and vehicle dynamics are captured such as traffic, round-abouts, hard-braking etc. on different road types (country roads, motorways etc.) with varying driving patterns. The dataset consists of a total driving time of about 40 hours over 1,300km for the vehicle extracted data and about 58 hours over 4,400 km for the smartphone recorded data. We hope that this dataset will prove valuable in furthering research on the correlation between vehicle dynamics and its displacement as well as other related studies"}

This revolution comes with numerous advantages and viable opportunities that can transform the world of wireless communications for the better. Solid-state LEDs are rapidly replacing the contemporary incandescent and fluorescent lamps. In addition to their high energy efficiency, LEDs are desirable for their low heat generation, long lifespan, and their capability to switch on and off at an extremely high rate. The ability of switching between different levels of luminous intensity at such a rate has enabled the inception of a new communication technology referred to as visible light communication (VLC). With this technology, the LED lamps are additionally being used for data transmission. This paper provides a tutorial and a survey of VLC in terms of the design, development, and evaluation techniques as well as current challenges and their envisioned solutions. The focus of this paper is mainly directed towards an indoor setup. An overview of VLC, theory of illumination, system receivers, system architecture, and ongoing developments are provided. We further provide some baseline simulation results to give a technical background on the performance of VLC systems. Moreover, we provide the potential of incorporating VLC techniques in the current and upcoming technologies such as fifth-generation (5G), beyond fifth-generation (B5G) wireless communication trends including sixth-generation (6G), and intelligent reflective surfaces (IRSs) among others."}

Given limited resources for HIV prevention, identifying PrEP provision strategies that maximize impact is critical.\nMETHODS: We used a stochastic individual-based network model to evaluate the direct (infections prevented among PrEP users) and indirect (infections prevented among non-PrEP users as a result of PrEP) benefits of PrEP, the person-years of PrEP required to prevent one HIV infection, and the community-level impact of providing PrEP to populations defined by gender and age in western Kenya and South Africa. We examined sensitivity of results to scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) by comparing two scenarios: maintaining current coverage (\"status quo\") and rapid scale-up to meet programmatic targets (\"fast-track\").\nRESULTS: The community-level impact of PrEP was greatest among women aged 15-24 due to high incidence, while PrEP use among men aged 15-24 yielded the highest proportion of indirect infections prevented in the community. These indirect infections prevented continue to increase over time (western Kenya: 0.4-5.5 (status quo); 0.4-4.9 (fast-track); South Africa: 0.5-1.8 (status quo); 0.5-3.0 (fast-track)) relative to direct infections prevented among PrEP users. The number of person-years of PrEP needed to prevent one HIV infection was lower (59 western Kenya and 69 in South Africa in the status quo scenario; 201 western Kenya and 87 in South Africa in the fast-track scenario) when PrEP was provided only to women compared with only to men over time horizons of up to 5 years, as the indirect benefits of providing PrEP to men accrue in later years.\nCONCLUSIONS: Providing PrEP to women aged 15-24 prevents the greatest number of HIV infections per person-year of PrEP, but PrEP provision for young men also provides indirect benefits to women and to the community overall. This finding supports existing policies that prioritize PrEP use for young women, while also illuminating the community-level benefits of PrEP availability for men when resources permit."}

However, it has not received enough attention compared to high-resolution images. Although high resolution images are more efficient for detection of land cover components, the analysis of low-resolution images are yet important due to the low-resolution repositories of the past satellite images used for timeseries analysis, free availability and economic concerns. In this paper, semantic segmentation of farm areas is addressed using low resolution satellite images. The segmentation is performed in two stages; First, local patches or Regions of Interest (ROI) that include farm areas are detected. Next, deep semantic segmentation strategies are employed to detect the farm pixels. For patch classification, two previously developed local patch classification strategies are employed; a two-step semi-supervised methodology using hand-crafted features and Support Vector Machine (SVM) modelling and transfer learning using the pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). For the latter, the high-level features learnt from the massive filter banks of deep Visual Geometry Group Network (VGG-16) are utilized. After classifying the image patches that contain farm areas, the DeepLabv3+ model is used for semantic segmentation of farm pixels. Four different pretrained networks, resnet18, resnet50, resnet101 and mobilenetv2, are used to transfer their learnt features for the new farm segmentation problem. The first step results show the superiority of the transfer learning compared to hand-crafted features for classification of patches. The second step results show that the model trained based on resnet50 achieved the highest semantic segmentation accuracy."}

Subsequent analyses of results collected in this way rely on the assumption that specific distances between verbal anchors placed on the scale exist and that relationships between verbal anchors from different dimensions that are assessed (e.g. thermal sensation and comfort) do not change. Another inherent assumption is that such scales are independent of the context in which they are used (climate zone, season, etc.). Despite their use worldwide, there is indication that contextual differences influence the way the scales are perceived and therefore question the reliability of the scales’ interpretation. To address this issue, a large international collaborative questionnaire study was conducted in 26 countries, using 21 different languages, which led to a dataset of 8225 questionnaires. Results, analysed by means of robust statistical techniques, revealed that only a subset of the responses are in accordance with the mentioned assumptions. Significant differences appeared between groups of participants in their perception of the scales, both in relation to distances of the anchors and relationships between scales. It was also found that respondents’ interpretations of scales changed with contextual factors, such as climate, season, and language. These findings highlight the need to carefully consider context-dependent factors in interpreting and reporting results from thermal comfort studies or post-occupancy evaluations, as well as to revisit the use of rating scales and the analysis methods used in thermal comfort studies to improve their reliability."}

While existing studies have mainly utilized joint computation with direct coordination between nodes in different segments, it is worth considering another scenario where an additional node within a layer relays data to another layer. As a consequence, the node can serve as an aggregation point for data capture units prior to transmission to the sink node. However, this new arrangement produces additional transmission paths and can thus cause additional energy spending. This pilot study investigates the joint computation problem aiming at optimizing energy consumption. Relevant components, such as computation and communication, are taken into account and modeled into formal representation. A genetic algorithm-based solution is then used as a tool to optimize parameter setup. According to the experiment results, the metaheuristic algorithm has potential to achieve the optimal system configuration, emphasizing the data length that affects the final energy spending on communications. However, the algorithm cannot always guarantee the optimality as it relies on the random variable used in the process."}

The numerical results show that the achievable spectral efficiency lessens as the multipath fading and shadowing parameters decrease (i.e., severe multipath fading and heavy shadowing become prevalent) or the delay constraint increases. The accuracy and tightness of the proposed bounds is demonstrated and approximate representations are also provided to verify their usefulness.

Under normality assumption for the genes, GRNs can be constructed by assessing the nonzero elements of the inverse covariance matrix. Nevertheless, such techniques are unable to deal with non-normality, multi-modality and heavy tailedness that are commonly seen in current massive genetic data. To relax this limitative constraint, one can apply copula function which is a multivariate cumulative distribution function with uniform marginal distribution. However, since the dependency structures of different pairs of genes in a multivariate problem are very different, the regular multivariate copula will not allow for the construction of an appropriate model. The solution to this problem is using Pair-Copula Constructions (PCCs) which are decompositions of a multivariate density into a cascade of bivariate copula, and therefore, assign different bivariate copula function for each local term. In fact, in this paper, we have constructed inverse covariance matrix based on the use of PCCs when the normality assumption can be moderately or severely violated for capturing a wide range of distributional features and complex dependency structure. To learn the non-Gaussian model for the considered GRN with non-Gaussian genomic data, we apply modified version of copula-based PC algorithm in which normality assumption of marginal densities is dropped. This paper also considers the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm to determine the existence of a time delay relation between two genes. Breast cancer is one of the most common diseases in the world where GRN analysis of its subtypes is considerably important; Since by revealing the differences in the GRNs of these subtypes, new therapies and drugs can be found.

Factors identified throughout this study are classified into six major categories and 23 sub-categories. Then the inter-dependencies between the barriers are studied by developing the correlation indices between the sub-categories. Results indicate that addressing the economic, social and regulatory barriers should be prioritized. Although the impact of barriers under perception, risk, compliance and market sub-categories are very pronounced, the highest inter-dependency among the sub-categories is found between perception and risk.

Along this trend, the existing medium-access control (MAC) protocol struggles to keep up with the unprecedented demand of vehicle monitoring sensors simultaneously emitting data, which can lead to packet collisions, severe network congestion and lost of time-critical data, due to the inflexible characteristics of the protocol. In order to mitigate these issues, this work proposes an enhanced MAC scheme that is scalable to account for diverse sensor-traffic quality of services. The hybrid scheme aims to effectively combine two procedures, namely history- and priority-based MAC, to allocate appropriate network resources for smooth transmission flow from multiple sensors. History-based MAC exploits historical contention data to optimize a near-future contention window that aims to minimize packet collision and expedite the average data delivery. Priority-based MAC assigns priority based on the time-criticality of the sensing data, which is subsequently being used to schedules network resources. Numerical results show the desirable performance of the hybrid scheme for IoT-IVWSNs in comparison to the existing MAC and sole history-based or priority-based strategies in the context of packet delivery ratio and transmission delay."}

Chatrabgoun"], "author_urls": ["https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/omid-chatrabgoun/"], "abstract": "The high velocity, variety and volume of data generation by today's systems have necessitated Big Data (BD) analytic techniques. This has penetrated a wide range of industries; BD as a notion has various types and characteristics, and therefore a variety of analytic techniques would be required. The traditional analysis methods are typically unable to analyse spatial-temporal BD. Interpolation is required to approximate the values between the already existing data points, yet since there exist both location and time dimensions, only a multivariate interpolation would be appropriate. Nevertheless, existing software are unable to perform such complex interpolations. To overcome this challenge, this paper presents a layer by layer interpolation approach for spatial-temporal BD. Developing this layered structure provides the opportunity for working with much smaller linear system of equations. Consequently, this structure increases the accuracy and stability of numerical structure of the considered BD interpolation. To construct this layer by layer interpolation, we have used the good properties of Radial Basis Functions (RBFs). The proposed new approach is applied to numerical examples in spatial-temporal big data and the obtained results confirm the high accuracy and low computational cost. Finally, our approach is applied to explore one of the air pollution indices, i.e. daily PM2.5 concentration, based on different stations in the contiguous United States, and it is evaluated by leave-one-out cross validation."}

Clustering is usually treated as an unsupervised machine learning task, but we can formulate a solution to a clustering problem by using a supervised classification algorithm [1]. However, these classification algorithms are highly computationally intensive in nature, so the overall complexity in designing a clustering solution is often very costly from an implementation point of view. The more data we use, the more computational power is required too. Recent advancements in quantum computing show promising advantages in dealing with this kind of computational issues we face while training a complex machine-learning algorithm. In this paper, we do a theoretical investigation on the runtime complexity of algorithms, from classical to randomized, and then to quantum frameworks, when designing a clustering algorithm. The analysis shows significant computational advantages with a quantum framework as compared to the classical and randomized versions of the implementation."}

Nelson informed members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that the Church teaching curriculum would shift focus away from lessons taught on Sunday. Instead, members were now asked to engage with ‘home-centred, church-supported’ religious instruction using the Church materials ‘Come, Follow Me’. In a religion where Church leaders still defend the idealised family structure of a stay-at-home mother and a father as the provider, the renewed emphasis on the domestic sphere as the site for Church teaching could also reinforce traditional Mormon gender roles. This article draws upon the lived religion of Latter-day Saint women in Sweden, Greece and England to understand how they negotiate gender in their homes. Looking at the implementation of ‘Come, Follow Me’ of sacralising of the home as a gendered practice, there appears to be reinforcing the primacy of the domestic space in the reproduction of religious practices and doctrinal instruction. Simultaneously, in conceptualising a gender role, the guardian of the family, I show the ways that European Latter-day Saint women are providing, protecting and nurturing their families. The domestic space then becomes instrumental in providing space for more nuanced, complex gender constructs that accommodate Mormon beliefs, cultural context and secular notions of gender without destabilising the institutional structure."}

In the absence of GNSS signals, information on the speed of the wheels of a vehicle (or other robots alike), recorded from the wheel encoder, can be used to provide continuous positioning information for the vehicle, through the integration of the vehicle's linear velocity to displacement. However, the displacement estimation from the wheel speed measurements are characterised by uncertainties, which could be manifested as wheel slips or/and changes to the tyre size or pressure, from wet and muddy road drives or tyres wearing out. As such, we exploit recent advances in deep learning to propose the Wheel Odometry neural Network (WhONet) to learn the uncertainties in the wheel speed measurements needed for correction and accurate positioning. The performance of the proposed WhONet is first evaluated on several challenging driving scenarios, such as on roundabouts, sharp cornering, hard-brake and wet roads (drifts). WhONet's performance is then further and extensively evaluated on longer-term GNSS outage scenarios of 30 s, 60 s, 120 s and 180 s duration, respectively over a total distance of 493 km. The experimental results obtained show that the proposed method is able to accurately position the vehicle with up to 93% reduction in the positioning error of its original counterpart (physics model) after any 180 s of travel."}

Micro-Doppler radars are an appealing solution considering their non-intrusiveness, deep penetration, and high-distance range. Unsupervised activity recognition using Doppler radar data has not received attention, in spite of its importance in case of unlabelled or poorly labelled activities in real scenarios. This study proposes two unsupervised feature extraction methods for the purpose of human activity monitoring using Doppler-streams. These include a local Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)-based feature extraction method and a local entropy-based feature extraction method. In addition, a novel application of Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) feature extraction is employed for the first time for Doppler radar data. The three feature extraction architectures are compared with the previously used Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) and linear feature extraction based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and 2DPCA. Unsupervised clustering is performed using K-Means and K-Medoids. The results show the superiority of DCT-based method, entropy-based method, and CVAE features compared to CAE, PCA, and 2DPCA, with more than 5%-20% average accuracy. In regards to computation time, the two proposed methods are noticeably much faster than the existing CVAE. Furthermore, for high-dimensional data visualisation, three manifold learning techniques are considered. The methods are compared for the projection of raw data as well as the encoded CVAE features. All three methods show an improved visualisation ability when applied to the encoded CVAE features."}

This study compares the understanding of HIV risk factors and utilization of some HIV services among religious groups in Zimbabwe.\n\nMethods\nWe conducted secondary data statistical analysis to investigate the understanding of HIV and associated risk factors among religious groups in Zimbabwe using 2015–2016 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey (ZDHS) data. We began by investigating associations between understanding of HIV and associated risk factors among religious groups. A multivariate stepwise backward elimination method was carried out to explore factors determining understanding of HIV risk after controlling for confounding factors using the most recent ZDHS data (2015–2016).\n\nResults\nThe results from the three surveys showed that, in general apostolic sector had low understanding of HIV and associated risk factors compared to other religious groups. Analysis of the 2015–2016 ZDHS data showed that women belonging to the apostolic sector were less likely to know where to get an HIV test odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval, 0.665 (0.503–0.880) and to know that male circumcision reduces HIV transmission OR 0.863 (0.781–0.955). Women from this group had no knowledge that circumcised men can be infected if they do not use condoms OR 0.633 (0.579–0.693), nor that it is possible for a healthy-looking person to have HIV, OR 0.814 (0.719–0.921). They would not buy vegetables from a vendor with HIV OR 0.817 (0.729–0.915) and were less likely to support that HIV positive children should be allowed to attend school with HIV negative children OR 0.804 (0.680–0.950). Similar results were obtained for men in the apostolic sector. These men also did not agree that women were justified to use condoms if the husband has an Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) OR 0.851 (0.748–0.967).\n\nConclusions\nOur results suggest that apostolic sector lack adequate knowledge of HIV and associated risk factors than other religious groups.

Unfortunately, even after the introduction of quantum mechanics to the world of computing, we still followed a similar sequential paradigm, which has not yet helped us obtain such an algorithm either. Here a completely different model of computing is proposed to replace the sequential paradigm of algorithms with inherent parallelism of physical processes. Using the proposed model, instead of writing algorithms to solve NP-complete problems, we construct physical systems whose equilibrium states correspond to the desired solutions and let them evolve to search for the solutions.

Using case studies that emerged from qualitative fieldwork, this article examines the role and impact of religion on children’s journeys through the care system, particularly in foster care. This article concludes that irrespective of the level of engagement Muslim heritage children in the care system have with their religious heritage, Islam has an enduring impact on how they perceive their identities. As a result, there is a pressing need for social workers and foster carers who care for these children to gain greater insights into Islam and Muslim culture. Such insights and understandings will help children settle faster and form stronger bonds of attachment with their foster carers, and in the long term, this will enhance life outcomes for these children."}

Specifically, an evidence base was built around two community co-conceived standalone photovoltaic-battery systems, which were deployed in two refugee camps in Rwanda. We found that for both installations (a micro-grid and a community hall electrification system) energy consumption levels were low, showing that sizeable energy consumption gaps can still develop when co-conceived interventions are deployed. The consumption gap led to low performance ratios (33% and 25% respectively for the micro-grid and community hall system). To guide further work and improve the sustainability of community interventions, we draw a number of design principles for future energy interventions in similar contexts. To deliver sustainable energy transitions for refugees, there needs to be a move towards co-creating community interventions that promote self-governance to position communities as users, maintainers and suppliers of energy services, throughout an intervention's lifetime."}

To assess their safe design and robust decision making in response to all possible scenarios, new methods that use a scenario-based testing approach are needed, as testing on public roads in normal traffic would require driving millions of kilometres. We make use of the scenario-based testing approach and propose a method to model simulated scenarios using Gaussian Process based models to predict untested scenario outcomes. This enables us to efficiently determine the performance boundary, where the safe and unsafe scenarios can be evidently distinguished from each other. We present an iterative method that optimises the parameter space of a logical scenario towards the most critical scenarios on this performance boundary. Additionally, we conduct a novel probabilistic sensitivity analysis by efficiently computing several variance-based sensitivity indices using the Gaussian Process models and evaluate the relative importance of the scenario input parameters on the scenario outcome. We critically evaluate and investigate the usefulness of the proposed Gaussian Process based approach as a very efficient surrogate model, which can model the logical scenarios effectively in the presence of uncertainty. The proposed approach is applied on an exemplary logical scenario and shows viability in finding concrete critical scenarios. The reported results, derived from the proposed approach, could pave the way to more efficient testing of automated vehicles and instruct further physical tests on the determined critical scenarios."}

Although TEE provides real-time 3D visualization of heart tissues and blood vessels and has no ionizing radiation, X-ray fluoroscopy still dominates in guidance of cardiac interventions due to TEE having a limited field of view and poor visualization of surgical instruments. Therefore, fusing 3D echo with live X-ray images can provide a better guidance solution. This paper proposes a novel framework for image fusion by detecting the pose of the TEE probe in X-ray images in real-time. The framework does not require any manual initialization. Instead it uses a cascade classifier to compute the position and in-plane rotation angle of the TEE probe. The remaining degrees of freedom are determined by fast marching against a template library. The proposed framework is validated on phantoms and patient data. The target registration error for the phantom was 2.1 mm. In addition, 10 patient datasets, seven of which were acquired from cardiac electrophysiology procedures and three from trans-catheter aortic valve implantation procedures, were used to test the clinical feasibility as well as accuracy. A mean registration error of 2.6 mm was achieved, which is well within typical clinical requirements."}

Besides, construction activities produce the highest amount of waste among all other sectors. According to the waste hierarchies, reuse is preferred to recycling; however, most of the recovery of construction and demolition wastes happens in the form of recycling and not reuse. Part of the recent efforts to promote the reuse rates includes estimating the reusability of the load-bearing building components to assist the stakeholders in making sound judgements of the reuse potentials at the end-of-life of a building and alleviate the uncertainties and perceived risks. This study aims to develop a probabilistic model using advanced supervised machine learning techniques (including random forest, K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm, Gaussian process, and support vector machine) to predict the reuse potential of structural elements at the end-of-life of a building. For this purpose, using an online questionnaire, this paper seeks the experts’ opinions with actual reuse experience in the building sector to assess the identified barriers by the authors in an earlier study. Furthermore, the results of the survey are used to develop an easy-to-understand learner for assessing the technical reusability of the structural elements at the end-of-life of a building.

However, there are still challenges to overcome, for instance, AVs need to accurately perceive their environment to safely navigate in busy urban scenarios. The aim of this paper is to review recent articles on computer vision techniques that can be used to build an AV perception system. AV perception systems need to accurately detect non-static objects and predict their behaviour, as well as to detect static objects and recognise the information they are providing. This paper, in particular, focuses on the computer vision techniques used to detect pedestrians and vehicles. There have been many papers and reviews on pedestrians and vehicles detection so far. However, most of the past papers only reviewed pedestrian or vehicle detection separately. This review aims to present an overview of the AV systems in general, and then review and investigate several detection computer vision techniques for pedestrians and vehicles. The review concludes that both traditional and Deep Learning (DL) techniques have been used for pedestrian and vehicle detection; however, DL techniques have shown the best results. Although good detection results have been achieved for pedestrians and vehicles, the current algorithms still struggle to detect small, occluded, and truncated objects. In addition, there is limited research on how to improve detection performance in difficult light and weather conditions. Most of the algorithms have been tested on well-recognised datasets such as Caltech and KITTI; however, these datasets have their own limitations. Therefore, this paper recommends that future works should be implemented on more new challenging datasets, such as PIE and BDD100K."}

As research has typically focused on optimising the digester and its associated parameters to maximise the biogas yield; this research examines how different objectives can influence how one might want to control the system. The system is initially modelled and validated with measured data and an optimisation algorithm is then applied to control the feedstock flow rate. The results show that the performance of first order AD models, in predicting the biogas yield, only differs from measured data by 9% and that by controlling the feeding rate, the amount of flared biogas and unmet cooking demand can be reduced by 100% and approximately 87%, respectively when they are the only objective functions considered. If the energy cost is also added an objective function, then more precise control of feeding rate is needed to ensure that all three conflicting objectives are equally minimised. This result highlights the importance of using the correct feeding rate in the system and considering the overall system during optimisation as producing more biogas might not result in the most cost-effectivesystem."}

Despite these advantages, APSoCs are sensitive to radiation like any other electronic device. Processors embedded in APSoCs, therefore, have to be adequately hardened against ionizing-radiation to make them a viable choice of design for harsh environments. This paper proposes a novel lockstep-based approach to harden the dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 processor in the Xilinx Zynq-7000 APSoC against radiation-induced soft errors by coupling it with a MicroBlaze TMR subsystem in the programmable logic (PL) layer of the Zynq. The proposed technique uses the concepts of checkpointing along with roll-back and roll-forward mechanisms at the software level, i.e. software redundancy, as well as processor replication and checker circuits at the hardware level (i.e. hardware redundancy). Results of fault injection experiments show that the proposed approach achieves high levels of protection against soft errors by mitigating around 98% of bit-flips injected into the register files of both ARM cores while keeping timing performance overhead as low as 25% if block and application sizes are adjusted appropriately. Furthermore, the incorporation of the roll-forward recovery operation in addition to the roll-back operation improves the Mean Workload between Failures (MWBF) of the system by up to ≈19% depending on the nature of the running application, since the application can proceed faster, in a scenario where a fault occurs, when treated with the roll-forward operation rather than roll-back operation. Thus, relatively more data can be processed before the next error occurs in the system."}

Complex nonlinear behaviours have been shown from the single neuron level to the system level. For decades, linear connectivity analysis methods, such as correlation, coherence and Granger causality, have been extensively used to assess the neural connectivities and input–output interconnections in neural systems. Recent studies indicate that these linear methods can only capture a certain amount of neural activities and functional relationships, and therefore cannot describe neural behaviours in a precise or complete way. In this review, we highlight recent advances in nonlinear system identification of neural systems, corresponding time and frequency domain analysis, and novel neural connectivity measures based on nonlinear system identification techniques. We argue that nonlinear modelling and analysis are necessary to study neuronal processing and signal transfer in neural systems quantitatively. These approaches can hopefully provide new insights to advance our understanding of neurophysiological mechanisms underlying neural functions. These nonlinear approaches also have the potential to produce sensitive biomarkers to facilitate the development of precision diagnostic tools for evaluating neurological disorders and the effects of targeted intervention."}

The faulty measurement is on the pitch angle.\nA jump Markov regularized particle filter is proposed for fault and state estimation of the nonlinear aircraft dynamics, with a Markovian jump strategy to manage the probabilistic transitions between the fault free and faulty modes. The jump strategy uses a small number of sentinel particles to continue testing the alternate hypothesis under both fault free and faulty modes. The proposed filter is shown to outperform the regularized particle filter for this application in terms of fault estimation accuracy and convergence time for scenarios involving both abrupt and incipient faults, without prior knowledge of the fault models. The state estimation is also more accurate and robust to faults using the proposed approach. The root-mean-square error for the altitude is reduced by 77% using the jump Markov regularized particle filter under a pitch sensor fault amplitude of up to 10 degrees. Performance enhancement compared to the regularized particle filter was found to be more pronounced when fault amplitudes increase."}

Methods such as $n:m$ phase locking value and bi-phase locking value have previously been proposed to quantify phase coupling between two resonant frequencies (e.g. f, 2f/3) and across three frequencies (e.g. f_1, f_2, f_1+f_2), respectively. However, the existing phase coupling metrics have their limitations and limited applications. They cannot be used to detect or quantify phase coupling across multiple frequencies (e.g. f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4, f_1+f_2+f_3-f_4), or coupling that involves non-integer multiples of the frequencies (e.g. f_1, f_2, 2f_1/3+f_2/3). To address the gap, this paper proposes a generalized approach, named multi-phase locking value (M-PLV), for the quantification of various types of instantaneous multi-frequency phase coupling. Different from most instantaneous phase coupling metrics that measure the simultaneous phase coupling, the proposed M-PLV method also allows the detection of delayed phase coupling and the associated time lag between coupled oscillators. The M-PLV has been tested on cases where synthetic coupled signals are generated using white Gaussian signals, and a system comprised of multiple coupled Rossler oscillators. Results indicate that the M-PLV can provide a reliable estimation of the time window and frequency combination where the phase coupling is significant, as well as a precise determination of time lag in the case of delayed coupling. This method has the potential to become a powerful new tool for exploring phase coupling in complex nonlinear dynamic systems."}

In this paper, a multi-swarm optimization algorithm integrated with Autodock environment is proposed to design a high-performance and high-efficiency docking program, namely, MSLDOCK. The search algorithm is a combination of the random drift particle swarm optimization with a novel multi-swarm strategy and the Solis and Wets local search method with a modified implementation. Due to the algorithm's structure, MSLDOCK also has a multithread mode. The experimental results reveal that MSLDOCK outperforms other two Autodock-based approaches in many aspects, such as self-docking, cross-docking, and virtual screening accuracies as well as docking efficiency. Moreover, compared with three non-Autodock-based docking programs, MSLDOCK can be a reliable choice for self-docking and virtual screening, especially for dealing with highly flexible ligand docking problems.

Yet, because PrEP reduces HIV risk, financial incentives to not use condoms may lead to risk compensation: reductions in condom use and/or increases in commercial sex, and may reduce the price of unprotected sex. In this analysis, we integrate market forces into a dynamic HIV transmission model to assess how risk compensation could change the impact of PrEP among FSWs and clients. We parameterise how sexual behavior may change with PrEP use among FSWs using stated preference data combined with economic theory. Our projections suggest the impact of PrEP is sensitive to risk compensatory behaviors driven by changes in the economics of sex work. Condom substitution could reduce the impact of PrEP on HIV incidence by 55%, while increases in the frequency of commercial sex to counter decreases in the price charged for unprotected sex among PrEP users could entirely mitigate the impact of PrEP. Accounting for competition between PrEP users and nonusers exacerbates this further. Alternative scenarios where increases in unprotected sex among PrEP users are balanced by decreases in non-PrEP users have the opposite effect, resulting in PrEP having much greater impact. Intervention studies need to determine how HIV prevention products may change the economics of sex work and provision of unprotected sex to enable a better understanding of their impact."}

This is not only a serious, but also a challenging task due to the complexities of the evacuees’ behaviors, route planning, and demanding coordination services. Although existing studies have addressed these challenges to some extent, mass evacuation in natural disasters tends to be difficult to predict and manage due to the limitation of the underlying models to capture realistic situations. It is therefore desirable to have on-demand mechanisms of locally-driven computing and data exchange services in order to enable near real-time capture of the disaster area during the evacuation. For this purpose, this paper comprehensively surveys recent advances in information and communication technology-enabled disaster evacuations, with the focus on fog computation and communication services to support a massive evacuation process. A numerous variety of tools and techniques are encapsulated within a coordinated on-demand strategy of an evacuation platform, which is aimed to provide a situational awareness and response. Herein fog services appear to be one of the viable options for responsive mass evacuation because they enable low latency data processing and dissemination. They can additionally provide data analytics support for autonomous learning for both the short-term guidance supports and long-term usages. This work extends the existing data-oriented framework by outlining comprehensive functionalities and providing seamless integration. We review the principles, challenges, and future direction of the state-of-the-art strategies proposed to sit within each functionality. Taken together, this survey highlights the importance of adaptive coordination and reconfiguration within the fog services to facilitate responsive mass evacuations as well as open up new research challenges associated with analytics-embedding network and computation, which is critical for any disaster recovery activities."}

These uncertainties could be manifested as changes in the tyre size or pressure, or wheel slips as a result of worn out tyres or wet/muddy road drive. The proposed solution has less integration steps in its computation, therefore providing the potential for a more accurate positioning estimation. Through a performance evaluation on several challenging scenarios for vehicular driving, such as hard braking, quick changes in vehicular acceleration, and wet/muddy road driving, we show that the wheel speed-based positioning approach is able to achieve up to 81.46 % improvement compared to the INS accelerometer approach."}

This paper proposes several efficient neural network-based solutions to estimate the error drifts using Recurrent Neural Networks, such as the Input Delay Neural Network (IDNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network (vRNN), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).

A diverse number of driving scenarios were captured such as traffic congestion, round-abouts, hard-braking, etc. on different road types (e.g. country roads, motorways, etc.) and with varying driving patterns. The dataset consists of a total driving time of about 40 h over 1,300 km for the vehicle extracted data and about 58 h over 4,400 km for the smartphone recorded data.

Cooperative relay-network architecture is the central element that leverages upon placement of cyber-enabled lampposts to allow for sensing-exchanging highway traffic information. Data accumulation is exploited to automate adaptive switching on/off the lighting and provide backtracking detection of faulty lampposts.

From the road user's perspective, the relay-network is envisaged to provide seamless driving experience where sufficient lighting is always perceived along the road. A critical analysis quantitatively evaluates the seamless driving experience considering car arrival rate, outage probability, and device malfunction probability. A road occupancy-based cost estimation analysis demonstrates the effective cost reduction of the proposal compared to existing systems. Furthermore, the performance of chosen communication modules under different setups is assessed through simulation, suggesting appropriate protocol for different highway traffic conditions."}

The main bottleneck is the unavailability of sufficiently large medical datasets required for the good performance of deep learning models. This paper proposes a new framework consisting of one variational autoencoder (VAE), two generative adversarial networks, and one auxiliary classifier to artificially generate realistic-looking skin lesion images and improve classification performance. We first train the encoder-decoder network to obtain the latent noise vector with the image manifold’s information and let the generative adversarial network sample the input from this informative noise vector in order to generate the skin lesion images. The use of informative noise allows the GAN to avoid mode collapse and creates faster convergence. To improve the diversity in the generated images, we use another GAN with an auxiliary classifier, which samples the noise vector from a heavy-tailed student t-distribution instead of a random noise Gaussian distribution. The proposed framework was named TED-GAN, with T from the t-distribution and ED from the encoder-decoder network which is part of the solution. The proposed framework could be used in a broad range of areas in medical imaging. We used it here to generate skin lesion images and have obtained an improved classification performance on the skin lesion classification task, rising from 66% average accuracy to 92.5%. The results show that TED-GAN has a better impact on the classification task because of its diverse range of generated images due to the use of a heavy-tailed t-distribution."}

The collected measurements are firstly fed into a feature selection module, where multiple state-of-the-art techniques have been used to extract the most informative features from the initial set of available features. The selected features are inputs to a knockoff generation module, where the generative adversarial networks are employed to generate the corresponding knockoffs of the selected features.

Before deploying autonomous vehicles publicly, their abilities must reach a safety threshold, not least with regards to vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians. In this paper, we present a novel Generative Adversarial Networks named the Ped-Cross GAN. Ped-Cross GAN is able to generate crossing sequences of pedestrians in the form of human pose sequences. The Ped-Cross GAN is trained with the Pedestrian Scenario dataset. The novel Pedestrian Scenario dataset, derived from existing datasets, enables training on richer pedestrian scenarios. We demonstrate an example of its use through training and testing the Ped-Cross GAN. The results show that the Ped-Cross GAN is able to generate new crossing scenarios that are of the same distribution from those contained in the Pedestrian Scenario dataset. Having a method with these capabilities is important for the future of transport, as it will allow for the adequate testing of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles on how they correctly perceive the intention of pedestrians crossing the street, ultimately leading to fewer pedestrian casualties on our roads."}

How can we define responsible? Is responsible innovation a theoretical nicety or can it ensure a just energy transition as outlined by the SDGs? What does responsible innovation look like in reality? Building to our underlying research question: what is the state-of-the-art in responsible innovation for humanitarian energy and how is it implemented at project level?"}

In this study, we investigate the use of a six-element distributed antenna system (DAS), operating at 5.8 GHz and mounted on the exterior (i.e., roof and wing mirrors) of an automobile, to enhance signal reliability for pedestrian-to-vehicle (P2V) communications. Due to its low complexity and ease of implementation, we consider the use of a switch-and-examine combining with post-examining selection (SECps) scheme to combine the signal received by the DAS. During our experiments, a pedestrian wearing a wireless device on their chest either stood stationary or walked by the side of a road. It was found that the overall signal reliability depends on not only the number, but also different groupings of the antennas which are selected. The goodness-of-fit results have shown that the temporal behavior of the diversity gain was adequately described by the Gaussian distribution. Building upon this, we also provide some useful insights into the antenna selection through the comparison of three different antenna selection mechanisms, namely per-sample random antenna selection, one-shot antenna selection and per-sample optimal antenna selection."}

In the quantum situation, it is known that three identical quantum particles will form a triplet with an infinite tower of bound states at the point where any pair of particles would have zero binding energy. The phase diagram is mapped out, and the different phase transitions are examined using finite-size scaling. We look particularly at the scaling of the DNA model at the equivalent Efimov point for chains up to 10 000 steps in length. We find clear evidence of several bound states in the finite-size scaling. We compare these states with the expected Efimov behavior."}

Current activity recognition techniques are using convolutional neural network (CNN) models with computationally complex classifiers, creating hurdles in obtaining quick responses for abnormal activities. To address these challenges in real-time surveillance, this paper proposes a lightweight deep learning-assisted framework for activity recognition. First, we detect a human in the surveillance stream using an effective CNN model, which is trained on two surveillance datasets. The detected individual is tracked throughout the video stream via an ultra-fast object tracker called the ‘minimum output sum of squared error’ (MOSSE). Next, for each tracked individual, pyramidal convolutional features are extracted from two consecutive frames using the efficient LiteFlowNet CNN. Finally, a novel deep skip connection gated recurrent unit (DS-GRU) is trained to learn the temporal changes in the sequence of frames for activity recognition. Experiments are conducted over five benchmark activity recognition datasets, and the results indicate the efficiency of the proposed technique for real-time surveillance applications compared to the state-of-the-art."}

Evaluation must account for social, political, environmental and other conditions, such as flood state expectations and local priorities. The evaluation method should be able to quickly identify evolving investment needs as the incidence and magnitude of flood events continue to grow. Quantification is essential and must consider multiple direct and indirect effects on flood related outcomes. The method proposed is this study is a Bayesian network, which may be used ex-post for evaluation, but also ex-ante for future assessment, and near real-time for the reallocation of investment into interventions. The particular case we study is the effect of flood interventions upon mental health, which is a gap in current investment analyses. Natural events such as floods expose people to negative mental health disorders including anxiety, distress and post-traumatic stress disorder. Such outcomes can be mitigated or exacerbated not only by state funded interventions, but by individual and community skills and experience. Success is also dampened when vulnerable and previously exposed victims are affected. Current measures evaluate solely the effectiveness of interventions to reduce physical damage to people and assets. This paper contributes a design for a Bayesian network that exposes causal pathways and conditional probabilities between interventions and mental health outcomes as well as providing a tool that can readily indicate the level of investment needed in alternative interventions based on desired mental health outcomes."}

We also employ a diversity controlling mechanism to avoid the premature convergence especially at the later stage of the search process, and thus further improve the performance of our proposed algorithm. In addition, we introduce a number of nondominated solutions to generate the global best for guiding other particles in the swarm. Experiments are conducted to compare the proposed algorithm, DMO-QPSO, with four multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithms and one multi-objective evolutionary algorithm on 15 test functions, including both bi-objective and tri-objective problems. The results show that the performance of the proposed DMO-QPSO is better than other five algorithms in solving most of these test problems.

However, like other PSO variants, the RDPSO algorithm also inevitably encounters premature convergence when solving multimodal problems. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel diversity collaboratively guided (DCG) strategy for the RDPSO algorithm that enhances the search ability of the algorithm. In this strategy, two kinds of diversity measures are defined and modified in a collaborative manner. Specifically, the whole search process of the RDPSO is divided into three phases based on the changes in the two diversity measures. In each phase, different values are selected for the key parameters of the update equation in the RDPSO to make the particle swarm perform different search modes. Consequently, the improved RDPSO algorithm with the DCG strategy (DCG-RDPSO) can maintain its diversity dynamically at a certain level, and thus can search constantly without stagnation until the search process terminates. The performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm is done on the CEC-2013 benchmark suite, in comparison with several versions of RDPSO, different variants of PSO and several non-PSO evolutionary algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed DCG strategy can significantly improve the performance and robustness of the RDPSO algorithm for most of the multimodal problems. Further experiments on economic dispatch problems also verify the effectiveness of the DCG strategy."}

The algorithm is a variant of Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD) adapted for satisfiability, where solution candidates (sample points) are constructed incrementally, either until a satisfying sample is found or sufficient samples have been sampled to conclude unsatisfiability. The choice of samples is guided by the input constraints and previous conflicts. The key idea behind our new approach is to start with a partial sample; demonstrate that it cannot be extended to a full sample; and from the reasons for that rule out a larger space around the partial sample, which build up incrementally into a cylindrical algebraic covering of the space. There are similarities with the incremental variant of CAD, the NLSAT method of Jovanović and de Moura, and the NuCAD algorithm of Brown; but we present worked examples and experimental results on a preliminary implementation to demonstrate the differences to these, and the benefits of the new approach."}

Accessible and non-invasive methods of diagnosing and characterising AD are therefore urgently required. Electroencephalography (EEG) fulfils these criteria and is often used when studying AD. Several features derived from EEG were shown to predict AD with high accuracy, e.g. signal complexity and synchronisation. However, the dynamics of how the brain transitions between stable states have not been properly studied in the case of AD and EEG data. Energy landscape analysis is a method that can be used to quantify these dynamics. This work presents the first application of this method to both AD and EEG. Energy landscape assigns energy value to each possible state, i.e. pattern of activations across brain regions. The energy is inversely proportional to the probability of occurrence. By studying the features of energy landscapes of 20 AD patients and 20 healthy age-matched counterparts, significant differences were found. The dynamics of AD patients' brain networks were shown to be more constrained - with more local minima, less variation in basin size, and smaller basins. We show that energy landscapes can predict AD with high accuracy, performing significantly better than baseline models."}

As mono‐sensor systems cannot provide reliable and consistent readings under all circum-stances because of errors and other limitations, fusing data from multiple sensors ensures that the environmental parameters are perceived correctly and reliably for most scenarios, thereby substan-tially improving the reliability of the multi‐sensor‐based automotive systems. This paper first high-lights the significance of efficiently fusing data from multiple sensors in ADAS features. An emergency brake assist (EBA) system is showcased using multiple sensors, namely, a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor and camera. The architectures of the proposed ‘centralised’ and ‘decentral-ised’ sensor fusion approaches for EBA are discussed along with their constituents, i.e., the detection algorithms, the fusion algorithm, and the tracking algorithm. The centralised and decentralised architectures are built and analytically compared, and the performance of these two fusion architectures for EBA are evaluated in terms of speed of execution, accuracy, and computational cost. While both fusion methods are seen to drive the EBA application at an acceptable frame rate (~20fps or higher) on an Intel i5‐based Ubuntu system, it was concluded through the experiments and analyt-ical comparisons that the decentralised fusion‐driven EBA leads to higher accuracy; however, it has the downside of a higher computational cost. The centralised fusion‐driven EBA yields compara-tively less accurate results, but with the benefits of a higher frame rate and lesser computational cost."}

Linear FC measures have been applied to study the differences in AD by splitting neurophysiological signals such as electroencephalography (EEG) recordings into discrete frequency bands and analysing them in isolation from each other. We address this limitation by quantifying cross-frequency FC in addition to the traditional within-band approach. Cross-bispectrum, a higher-order spectral analysis approach, is used to measure the nonlinear FC and is compared with the cross-spectrum, which only measures the linear FC within bands. This work reports the first use of cross-bispectrum to reconstruct a cross-frequency FC network where each frequency band is treated as a layer in a multilayer network with both inter- and intra-layer edges. An increase of within-band FC in AD is observed in low-frequency bands using both methods. Bispectrum also detects multiple cross-frequency differences, mainly increased FC in AD in delta-theta coupling. An increased importance of low-frequency coupling and decreased importance of high-frequency coupling is observed in AD. Integration properties of AD networks are more vulnerable than HC, while the segregation property is maintained in AD. Moreover, the segregation property of γ is less vulnerable in AD, suggesting the shift of importance from high-frequency activity towards low-frequency components. The results highlight the importance of studying nonlinearity and including cross-frequency FC in characterising AD. Moreover, the results demonstrate the advantages and limitations of using bispectrum to reconstruct FC networks."}

To achieve this, we measured the signal power simultaneously received at nine ceiling-mounted access point (AP) locations likely to be used in future indoor DAS deployments while a mobile user imitated making a voice call on a hypothetical user equipment. Key metrics, associated with the performance of multiple antenna systems, such as the cross correlation coefficient (CCC) and channel power imbalance (CPI) are determined. It was found that line-of-sight (LOS) and quasi-LOS (QLOS) links with the APs typically led to higher CCC values than the non-LOS (NLOS) cases. Similarly, LOS and QLOS links typically produced higher CPI values between APs than the NLOS case. To enable the reproduction of our results, we have successfully applied autoregressive moving average and autoregressive integrated moving average modeling to the CCC and CPI time series. The performance improvement that can be achieved using a DAS instead of a single AP was evaluated using three commonly deployed diversity combining schemes, namely, selection combining, equal gain combining, and maximal ratio combining along with three AP selection mechanisms, namely, per-sample random AP selection, one-shot AP selection, and per-sample optimal AP selection.

IoD paradigm offers a wide range of applications mainly targeting the military and civilian environments. Some of those applications include transportation, agriculture-based systems, entertainment, weather monitoring, healthcare systems, and road hazards monitoring. However, once an area is highly congested by a various number of drones, dynamic or statics obstacles can hinder the overall performance of drones.

Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks have found use in challenging time-dependent applications such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), financial analysis and sensor fusion due to their capability to cope with the vanishing gradient problem. GRUs are also known to be more computationally efficient than their variant, the Long Short-Term Memory neural network (LSTM), due to their less complex structure and as such, are more suitable for applications requiring more efficient management of computational resources. Many of such applications require a stronger mapping of their features to further enhance the prediction accuracy. A novel Quaternion Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU) is proposed in this paper, which leverages the internal and external dependencies within the quaternion algebra to map correlations within and across multidimensional features. The QGRU can be used to efficiently capture the inter- and intra-dependencies within multidimensional features unlike the GRU, which only captures the dependencies within the sequence. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated on a sensor fusion problem involving navigation in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) deprived environments as well as a human activity recognition problem. The results obtained show that the QGRU produces competitive results with almost 3.7 times fewer parameters compared to the GRU.

One recent aspect of the efforts to improve reuse rates in buildings is estimating the reusability of the structural elements. This study develops a probabilistic predictive model using advanced supervised machine learning methods to evaluate the economic reusability of the load-bearing building elements. The results of sensitivity analysis and visualization techniques used in this study reveal that the most important economic factor is the need to purchase reused elements early in a project, which could have cash flow implications. The other most important factors are the potential financial risks, the procurement process, and the labour cost. This study unveils that the relationship between variables is not linear, and none of the identified factors could alone determine if an element is reusable or not. This study concludes that the complex interdependencies of factors affecting reuse cause a high level of uncertainty about the feasibility of reusing the load-bearing building structural components from an economic aspect. Nonetheless, this paper reveals that by using the probability theory foundations and combining it with advanced supervised machine learning methods, it is possible to develop tools that could reliably estimate the economic reusability of these elements based on affecting variables. Therefore, the authors suggest utilizing the approach developed in this research to promote the circularity of materials in different subsectors of the construction industry."}

Many factors and constraints need to be considered when modelling this storage allocation problem. These constraints include the size, type and weight of the containers. The factors are the number of containers in a stack and the duration of stay of the topmost container in the stack. This paper aims to develop an improved Fuzzy Knowledge-Based ‘FKB’ model for best allocation\npractice of long-stay containers in a yard. In this model, the duration of stay factor does not need to be considered in the allocation decision if the duration of stay for the topmost containers in a stack is similar; hence, a new ‘ON/OFF’ strategy is proposed within the Fuzzy Knowledge-Based model to activate/deactivate this factor in the stacking algorithm whenever is required. Discrete Event Simulation and Fuzzy Knowledge-Based techniques are used to develop the proposed model.

This paper introduces a novel semi-supervised image segmentation method for satellite image segmentation. Unlike the semantic segmentation strategies, this method requires only limited labelled data from small local patches of satellite images. Due to the complexity and large number of land cover objects in satellite images, a fixed-size square window is used for feature extraction from 7 different local areas. The local features are extracted by spectral domain analysis. Then, classification is performed based on similarity of the local features to those of the\n7 labelled patches. This also allows efficient selection of the suitable window scale. Furthermore, the labeled features remove the need for iterative clustering for decision making about features. The labelled data also allows learning a subspace of transformed features for segmentation of water and green area based on simple thresholding. Comparison of the segmentation results using the\nproposed strategy compared to unsupervised techniques such as k-means clustering and Superpixel-based Fast Fuzzy C-Means Clustering (SFFCM) shows the superiority of the proposed strategy in terms of content-based segmentation."}

These associated uncertainties occur because the arrival of a truck to pick up the container is random, so the departure time of the container is unknown. The problem investigated in this paper emerges when newly arrived containers of different sizes, types and weights require storage operation in the same yard where other containers have already been stored. This situation becomes more challenging when the time of departure of existing container is not known. This study develops a new Fuzzy Knowledge-Based optimisation system named ‘FKB_GA’ for optimal storage and retrieval of containers in a yard that contains long stay pre-existing containers. The containers’ duration of stay factor is considered along with two other factors such as the similarity (containers with same customer) and the quantity of containers per stack.\nA new Multi-Layered Genetic Algorithm module is proposed which identifies the optimal fuzzy rules required for each set of fired rules to achieve a minimum number of container re-handlings when selecting a stack. An industrial case study is used to demonstrate the applicability and practicability of the developed system."}

Displaced settlements often lack street lighting and electricity. Given that off-grid solar streetlights produce surplus energy, we hypothesized that this energy could be made available for daily usage, to improve system performance and provide further energy access to displaced populations. We recognize, however, that solar streetlight performance and longevity have typically been poor in remote and refugee settings. Eleven solar streetlights were fitted with ground-level sockets and their performance monitored, in two displaced settlements: a refugee camp in Rwanda and an internally displaced population settlement in Nepal. Considerable performance gaps were found across all eleven systems. Inefficient lights and mismatching system components were major issues at both sites, reducing targeted designed performance ratios by 33% and 53% on average in Rwanda and Nepal, respectively. The challenges of deploying these types of systems in temporary settlements are outlined and a number of suggestions are made to guide future developments in the design and implementation of sustainable solar streetlight interventions."}

This work makes use of an unsupervised learning method, called hierarchical clustering, in an attempt to create an artificial sensor to detect two different cyber-sabotage cases, known as false data injection and denial-of-service, during the dynamic behavior of the power system. The detection process is conducted by using an unsupervised learning-enhanced approach, and a decision tree regressor is then employed for removing the threat. The dynamic state estimation of the power system is done by Kalman filters, which provide benefits in terms of the speed and accuracy of the process. Measurement devices in utilities and buses are vulnerable to communication interruptions between phasor measurement units and operators, who can be easily manipulated by false data. While Kalman filters are incapable of detecting the majority of such cyber-attacks, this article proves that the proposed unsupervised machine learning method is able to detect more than 90 percent of the mentioned attacks.

In this article, inspired by the random drift particle swarm optimization (RDPSO) algorithm, we propose a novel hybrid framework based on a combination of the RDPSO with the hidden MRF model and the expectation–maximization algorithm (HMRF-EM), to be used for MRI segmentation in real-time environments. The proposed hybrid framework is compared with the standalone HMRF-EM method, two other MRF-based stochastic relaxation algorithms, and two widely used brain tissue segmentation toolboxes on both simulated and real MRI datasets.

Hence, a fully parallel architecture for the SOM is introduced to optimize the system’s data processing time. Unlike most literature approaches, the architecture proposed here does not contain sequential steps - a common limiting factor for processing speed. The architecture was validated on FPGA and evaluated concerning hardware throughput and the use of resources. Comparisons to the state of the art show a speedup of 8.91x over a partially serial implementation, using less than 15% of hardware resources available. Thus, the method proposed here points to a hardware architecture that will not be obsolete quickly."}

These are per-sample random AP selection, one-shot AP selection and per-sample optimal AP selection. To facilitate our analysis, we used a customized measurement system operating at 60 GHz, to record the signal power time series simultaneously received at 9 ceiling mounted AP locations while a mobile user imitating a voice call application. Using the time series data, the localized cross correlation coefficient (CCC) was subsequently estimated from the raw received signal strength (RSS) using the Spearman's rank-order correlation. It was found that the resultant time series of the localized CCCs was well-described by the Gaussian distribution across all of the considered measurement scenarios. Moreover, it was observed that the line-of-sight (LOS) and quasi-LOS (QLOS) paths typically led to higher CCC values with broader spreads than the non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios. To study the potential for signal enhancement by using diversity combining in mmWave DASs, we applied selection combining, equal gain combining and maximal ratio combining before investigating the AP selection mechanisms.

One weighting scheme, called PMIdist, revises the Point-wise Mutual Information (PMI) method by scaling the co-occurrence counts according to the distance between a word and the context. The second weighting scheme is a ratio that can measure the contextual position variation within the window of a given word. Then, the refined word association in PMIDP is defined as the multiplication of the two proposed weighting schemes, which essentially aims to flexibly adjust the word association when solving target-oriented similarity tasks. The proposed word association method has been applied on two widely known models, i.e., the positive PMI matrix with truncated Singular Vector Decomposition (PPMI-SVD) model and the Global Vectors (GloVe) model. Experimental results demonstrate that the PMIDP method can significantly improve the performances of the two models on both semantic and relational similarity tasks and show advantages when compared with other state-of-the-art models."}

The method is demonstrated for a case study plant in Bangalore, India, using onsite kitchen waste to provide biogas for cooking. The AD system is modelled using Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1) and a genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to control the substrate feeding rate in order to simultaneously minimise the volume of flared biogas, unmet gas demand and energy cost. Our results show that ADM1 can predict biogas yield from a continuously operated digester well with mean percentage error between daily predicted and measured data values of only 5.7% for March 2017 and 17.8% for July 2017. When biogas flaring and unmet gas demand were minimised, the amount of biogas flared reduced from 886.62 m3 to 88.87 m3 in March and from 73.79 m3 to 68.49 m3 in July. When the energy cost was also considered within an objective function, the biogas flared reduced from 886.62 m3 to 281.27 m3 for March, but increased from 73.79 m3 to 180.11 m3 for July. The amount of flaring increased in July as the energy cost function increased biogas yield without considering surplus gas production beyond demand and storage capacity. As AD systems are often operated to maximise biogas production, these results highlight the need for multi-objective optimisation, particularly for off-grid AD systems."}

This paper focuses on a novel and different approach: using machine learning algorithms on consumer electronic level Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to tackle TID effects and monitor them to replace before they stop working. This condition has a research challenge to anticipate when the board results in a total failure due to TID effects. We observed internal measurements of the FPGA boards under gamma radiation and used three different anomaly detection machine learning (ML) algorithms to detect anomalies in the sensor measurements in a gamma-radiated environment. The statistical results show a highly significant relationship between the gamma radiation exposure levels and the board measurements. Moreover, our anomaly detection results have shown that a One-Class Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function Kernel has an average Recall score of 0.95.

In ADAS, the use of multiple sensors to gauge the environment surrounding the ego-vehicle offers numerous advantages, as fusing information from more than one sensor helps to provide highly reliable and error-free data. The fused data is typically then fed to a tracker algorithm, which helps to reduce noise and compensate for situations when received sensor data is temporarily absent or spurious, or to counter the offhand false positives and negatives. The performances of these constituent algorithms vary vastly under different scenarios. In this paper, we focus on the variation in the performance of tracker algorithms in sensor fusion due to the alteration in external conditions in different scenarios, and on the methods for countering that variation. We introduce a sensor fusion architecture, where the tracking algorithm is spontaneously switched to achieve the utmost performance under all scenarios. By employing a Real-time Traffic Density Estimation (RTDE) technique, we may understand whether the ego-vehicle is currently in dense or sparse traffic conditions. A highly dense traffic (or congested traffic) condition would mean that external circumstances are non-linear; similarly, sparse traffic conditions would mean that the probability of linear external conditions would be higher. We also employ a Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) algorithm, which is able to monitor for construction zones, junctions, schools, and pedestrian crossings, thereby identifying areas which have a high probability of spontaneous, on-road occurrences. Based on the results received from the RTDE and TSR algorithms, we construct a logic which switches the tracker of the fusion architecture between an Extended Kalman Filter (for linear external scenarios) and an Unscented Kalman Filter (for non-linear scenarios). This ensures that the fusion model always uses the tracker that is best suited for its current needs, thereby yielding consistent accuracy across multiple external scenarios, compared to the fusion models that employ a fixed single tracker."}

A framework for solving such problems is to employ Gaussian process (GP) emulators which are well-known as nonparametric Bayesian machine learning techniques. GPs are among a class of methods known as kernel machines which can be used to approximate rather complex problems by tuning their hyperparameters. The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) has widely been used to estimate the parameters of the operators and kernels. However, the MLE-based and Bayesian inference in the standard form are usually involved in setting up a covariance matrix which is generally ill-conditioned. As a result, constructing and inverting the covariance matrix using the standard form will become unstable to learn the parameters in the operational equations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to tackle these computational complexities and also resolve the ill-conditioning problem by forming the covariance matrix using alternative bases via the Hilbert−Schmidt SVD (HS-SVD) approach. Applying this approach yields a novel matrix factorization of the block-structured covariance matrix which can be implemented stably by isolating the main source of the ill-conditioning. In contrast to standard matrix decompositions which start with a matrix and produce the resulting factors, the HS-SVD is constructed from the Hilbert−Schmidt eigenvalues and eigenvectors without the need to ever form the potentially ill-conditioned matrix. We also provide stable MLE and Bayesian inference to adaptively estimate hyperparameters, and the corresponding operators can then be efficiently predicted at some new points using the proposed HS-SVD bases. The efficiency and stability of the proposed HS-SVD method will be compared with the existing methods by several illustrations of the parametric linear equations, such as ordinary and partial differential equations, and integro-differential and fractional order operators."}

The grid under study is a DC microgrid with distributed boost converters, where the false data are injected into the voltage data so as to investigate the effect of attacks. The proposed algorithm uses a bank of sliding mode observers that estimates the states of the neighbor agents. Each agent estimates the neighboring states and, according to the estimation and communication data, the detection mechanism reveals the presence of FDIA. The proposed control scheme provides resiliency to the system by replacing the conventional consensus rule with attack-resilient ones. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method, a real-time simulation with eight agents has been performed. Moreover, a verification experimental test with three boost converters has been utilized to confirm the simulation results. It is shown that the proposed algorithm is able to detect FDI attacks and it protects the consensus deviation against FDI attacks."}

Over the past few decades, various docking programs have been developed, some of them employing novel optimization algorithms. However, most of those methods cannot simultaneously achieve both good efficiency and accuracy. Therefore, it is worthwhile to pour the efforts into the development of a docking program with fast speed and high quality of the solutions obtained. The research presented in this paper, based on the docking scheme of Vina, developed a novel docking program called RDPSOVina. The RDPSOVina employes a novel search algorithm but the same scoring function of Vina. It utilizes the random drift particle swarm optimization (RDPSO) algorithm as the global search algorithm, implements the local search with small probability, and applies Markov chain mutation to the particles' personal best positions in order to harvest more potential-candidates. To prove the outstanding docking performance in RDPSOVina, we performed the re-docking experiments on two PDBbind datasets and cross-docking experiments on the Sutherland-crossdock-set, respectively. The RDPSOVina exhibited superior protein-ligand docking accuracy and better cross-docking prediction with higher operation efficiency than most of the compared methods.

In this paper, we extend our previous work by prepossessing a localization and mapping architecture for autonomous vehicles that do not rely on GPS, particularly in environments such as tunnels, under bridges, urban canyons, and dense tree canopies. The proposed approach is of two parts. Firstly, a K-means algorithm is employed to extract features from LiDAR scenes to create a local map of each scan. Then, we concatenate the local maps to create a global map of the environment and facilitate data association between frames. Secondly, the main localization task is performed by an adaptive particle filter that works in four steps: (a) generation of particles around an initial state (provided by the GPS); (b) updating the particle positions by providing the motion (translation and rotation) of the vehicle using an inertial measurement device; (c) selection of the best candidate particles by observing at each timestamp the match rate (also called particle weight) of the local map (with the real-time distances to the objects) and the distances of the particles to the corresponding chunks of the global map; (d) averaging the selected particles to derive the estimated position, and, finally, using a resampling method on the particles to ensure the reliability of the position estimation. The performance of the newly proposed technique is investigated on different sequences of the Kitti and Pandaset raw data with different environmental setups, weather conditions, and seasonal changes. The obtained results validate the performance of the proposed approach in terms of speed and representativeness of the feature extraction for real-time localization in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods."}

Among the various machine learning techniques, kernel-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been commonly employed to discriminate between interacting and non-interacting protein pairs. The main drawback of employing the kernel-based SVM to datasets with many features, such as the primary sequence-based protein-protein dataset, is the significant increase in computational time of training stage. This increase in computational time is mainly due to the presence of the kernel in solving the quadratic optimisation problem (QOP) involved in nonlinear SVM. In order to fix this issue, we propose a novel and efficient computational algorithm by approximating the kernel-based SVM using a low-rank truncated Mercer series as well as desired. As a result, the QOP for the approximated kernel-based SVM will be very tractable in the sense that there is a significant reduction in computational time of training and validating stages. We illustrate the novelty of the proposed method by predicting the PPIs of \"S. Cerevisiae” where the protein features extracted using the multiscale local descriptor (MLD), and then we compare the predictive performance of the proposed low-rank approximation with the existing methods. Finally, the new method results in significant reduction in computational time for predicting PPIs with almost as accuracy as kernel-based SVM"}

Since it was proposed, some of its variants, such as PSOVina and GWOVina, have also been developed. However, for all these docking programs, there is still large room for performance improvement.\n\nResults:\nIn this work, we propose a parallel multi-swarm cooperative particle swarm model, in which one master swarm and several slave swarms mutually cooperate and co-evolve. Our experiments show that multi-swarm programs possess better docking robustness than PSOVina. Moreover, the multi-swarm program based on random drift PSO can achieve the best highest accuracy of protein–ligand docking, an outstanding enrichment effect for drug-like activate compounds, and the second best AUC screening accuracy among all the compared docking programs, but with less computation consumption than most of the other docking programs.\n\nConclusion:\nThe proposed multi-swarm cooperative model is a novel algorithmic modeling suitable for protein–ligand docking and virtual screening. Owing to the existing coevolution between the master and the slave swarms, this model in parallel generates remarkable docking performance.

Our results show that a proper characterisation of LoRa orthogonality extends the scalability of the network. They also highlight that for low/medium densities decreasing the SF extends the spanned spectrum of sensing applications characterised by their traffic requirements (i.e., sensing rate). However, for high density (>104 nodes/Km2), the Pareto frontiers converge to a stability limit governed by the SF allocation scheme and the predefined capture thresholds. The results further evince the importance of capturing threshold distribution among the SFs to mitigate the unfair latency."}

Methods such as n:m phase locking value (where two coupling frequencies are linked as: mf1=nf2) and bi-phase locking value have previously been proposed to quantify phase coupling between two resonant frequencies (e.g. f,2f/3) and across three frequencies (e.g. f1,f2,f1+f2), respectively. However, the existing phase coupling metrics have their limitations and limited applications. They cannot be used to detect or quantify phase coupling across multiple frequencies (e.g. f1,f2,f3,f4,f1+f2+f3-f4), or coupling that involves non-integer multiples of the frequencies (e.g. f1,f2,2f1/3+f2/3). New methods: To address the gap, this paper proposes a generalized approach, named multi-phase locking value (M-PLV), for the quantification of various types of instantaneous multi-frequency phase coupling. Different from most instantaneous phase coupling metrics that measure the simultaneous phase coupling, the proposed M-PLV method also allows the detection of delayed phase coupling and the associated time lag between coupled oscillators. Results: The M-PLV has been tested on cases where synthetic coupled signals are generated using white Gaussian signals, and a system comprised of multiple coupled Rössler oscillators, as well as a human subject dataset. Results indicate that the M-PLV can provide a reliable estimation of the time window and frequency combination where the phase coupling is significant, as well as a precise determination of time lag in the case of delayed coupling. This method has the potential to become a powerful new tool for exploring phase coupling in complex nonlinear dynamic systems."}

Specifically, we develop a new MC SDE method to overcome the challenges in calculating a time-dependent PDF and information geometric diagnostics and to speed up simulations by utilizing GPU computing. Using MC SDE simulations, we reproduce Information Geometric scaling relations found from the Fokker−Planck method for the case of a stochastic process with linear and cubic damping terms. We showcase the advantage of MC SDE simulation over FPE solvers by calculating unequal time joint PDFs. For the linear process with a linear damping force, joint PDF is found to be a Gaussian. In contrast, for the cubic process with a cubic damping force, joint PDF exhibits a bimodal structure, even in a stationary state. This suggests a finite memory time induced by a nonlinear force. Furthermore, several power-law scalings in the characteristics of bimodal PDFs are identified and investigated."}

The networks are subject to operational constraints, voltage limits at each node, rated capacities for the power electronic devices, and current bounds for distribution lines. These economic and technical constraints, coupled with intermittent renewable injection, may pose a threat to system stability and performance. In this article, we propose a novel holistic approach to energy trading composed of a distributed predictive control framework to handle physical interactions, i.e., voltage constraints and power dispatch, together with a negotiation framework to determine pricing policies for energy transactions. We study the effect of forecasting generation and consumption on the overall network's performance and market behaviors. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis for both the negotiation framework and the distributed control. Finally, we assess the impact of forecasting in the proposed system with the aid of testing scenarios."}

Since the human factor is the preeminent cause behind the traffic accidents, the development of reliable Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADASs) and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is seen by many as a possible solution to improve road safety. ADASs rely on the car perception system input that consists of camera(s), LIDAR and/or radar to detect pedestrians and other objects on the road. Hardware improvements as well as advances done in employing Deep Learning techniques for object detection popularized the Convolutional Neural Networks in the area of autonomous driving research and applications. However, the availability of quality and large datasets continues to be a most important issue that influences the Deep Learning based model’s performance. With this in mind, this work analyses how a YOLO-based object detection architecture responded to limited data available for training and containing low-quality images. The work focused on pedestrian detection, since vulnerable road user’s safety is a major concern within AV and ADAS research communities. The proposed model was trained and tested on data gathered from Coventry, United Kingdom, city streets. The results show that the original YOLOv3 implementation reaches a 42.18 % average precision (AP), and the main challenge was in detecting small objects. Network modifications were made and our final model, based on the original YOLOv3 implementation, achieved 51.6 % AP. It is also demonstrated that the employed data augmentation approach is responsible for doubling the average precision of the final model."}

The basin is huge, with few roads, many rivers, and conservative areas, which is an enormous challenge in terms of logistics and electrification costs. This paper describes a case study at the Nova Esperança community site in the Cuieiras River, Brazil. The community received stand-alone solar photovoltaic systems in 2018 and 2019. The process started with a survey and finished with an interview with each dweller that received a 975 W and 2-day autonomy photovoltaic system. A monitoring system was developed and deployed, and weather monitoring was performed to evaluate the impact of high temperatures on the equipment. The community does not have cell phone coverage and it is far from the main cities. We claim that the model created and adopted in the case study has interesting outcomes, even considering a small budget. Some houses, after 1 year of deployment, had their electrical demand rise by 300%, and 50% improved their income. We estimate the number of greenhouse gases annually avoided after electrification, replacing the consumed fossil fuel. The project also estimates the expenditure on energy sources that residents used due to the lack of electricity, which they stopped doing after electrification. The avoided expense can cover maintenance costs over the years. The goals of the SDG that were covered by the project are good health and well-being, accessible and clean energy, sustainable cities and communities, combating climate change, and partnerships for the goals."}

In flood modelling, many hydraulic and hydrodynamic numerical models, especially when operating at high spatiotemporal resolutions, have prohibitively high computational costs for tasks requiring the instantaneous generation of very large numbers of simulation results. This study examines the appropriateness and robustness of Gaussian Process (GP) models to emulate the results from a hydraulic inundation model. The developed GPs produce real-time predictions based on the simulation output from LISFLOOD-FP numerical model. An efficient dimensionality reduction scheme is developed to tackle the high dimensionality of the output space and is combined with the GPs to investigate the predictive performance of the proposed emulator for estimation of the inundation depth. The developed GP-based framework is capable of robust and straightforward quantification of the uncertainty associated with the predictions, without requiring additional model evaluations and simulations. Further, this study explores the computational advantages of using a GP-based emulator over alternative methodologies such as neural networks, by undertaking a comparative analysis. For the case study data presented in this paper, the GP model was found to accurately reproduce water depths and inundation extent by classification and produce computational speedups of approximately 10,000 times compared with the original simulator, and 80 times for a neural network-based emulator."}

Yet, there is a widening gap between over 80 million displaced people and the political will to meet their needs. Improving energy access in the displaced setting to build capacity and resilience requires meaningful integration of the needs of communities throughout the design, delivery and evaluation process within the socio-technical energy system. This paper aims to explore the ways in which co-design is conceptualised and applied, from an interdisciplinary perspective, within the socio-technical framing. We do this by first conducting a rapid review of relevant co-design literature to understand theories, typologies and identify methods of best co-design practice in the Humanitarian Energy sector. Second, we present the Humanitarian Engineering and Energy for Displacement project as a co-design case study for Humanitarian Energy using Technology Implementation Model for Energy (TIME) as a framework for analysis. Our rapid review resulted in the typology of the Spectrum of Co-Design, a mapping of differing conceptualisations of co-design showing their positioning and interactions. Our results show that by exploring if and how conceptual frameworks, such as TIME, adds value to practitioner orientated humanitarian programming this can make a significant contribution to future proofing energy systems that seek to deliver inclusive, sustainable and just transitions. We highlight specific learnings from HEED around the disconnection between perceptions of key stakeholder roles, misunderstandings of energy access and use, and building trusting partnerships through the creation of meaningful rectification pathways."}

However, these generated expressions do not represent a realistic dataset that draws from the typical Maple user’s experience.\n\nI propose a framework for generating valid mathematical expressions. More precisely, the focus will be on integrable expressions. The difference from other methods lies in the fact that the data generation method will be based on a test suite of data generated from Maple users. Thus, the new synthetic data will have properties similar to integrable expressions that Maple users would typically try. This data generation method will be used to train machine learning models that make efficient choices algorithm selection problems."}

A general finding was that human and automated feedback are different but complementary. However there are different feedback needs by group. Our findings imply: (1) that a blended human-automated feedback approach improves engagement; and (2) that this approach needs to be differentiated according to type of student. We give implications for the design of feedback for programming modules."}

Optimising these systems and their controllers might be possible with computationally efficient simulation. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art simulators are either too slow or provide little resolution of the cabin's thermal environment. In this work, we propose a novel approach to developing a fast simulation by machine learning (ML) from measurements within the car cabin over a number of trials within a climatic wind tunnel. A range of ML approaches are tried and compared. The best-performing ML approach is compared to more traditional 1D simulation in terms of accuracy and speed. The resulting simulation, based on Multivariate Linear Regression, is fast (5 microseconds per simulation second), and yields good accuracy (NRMSE 1.8%), which exceeds the performance of the traditional 1D simulator. Furthermore, the simulation is able to differentially simulate the thermal environment of the footwell versus the head and the driver position versus the front passenger seat, but unlike a traditional 1D model cannot support changes to the physical structure.\nThis fast method for obtaining computationally efficient simulators of car cabins will accelerate adoption of techniques such as Deep Reinforcement Learning for climate control."}

The groups of mice were numbered Mice Group 1–4, depending on the diabetes severity of each group, with severity increasing from group 1–4. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo method based on a Bayesian framework was used to fit the model to determine the best model structure. Akaike information criteria (AIC) and Bayesian information criteria (BIC) approaches were used to assess the best model structure for type 1 diabetes. In fitting the model with no β-cells to glucose level data, we varied insulin absorption rate and insulin clearance rate. However, the model with β-cells required more parameters to match the data and we fitted the β-cell glucose tolerance factor, whole body insulin clearance rate, glucose production rate, and glucose clearance rate. Fitting the models to the blood glucose concentration level gave the least difference in AIC of 1.2, and a difference in BIC of 0.12 for Mice Group 4. The estimated AIC and BIC values were highest for Mice Group 1 than all other mice groups. The models gave substantial differences in AIC and BIC values for Mice Groups 1–3 ranging from 2.10 to 4.05. Our results suggest that the model without β-cells provides a more suitable structure for modelling type 1 diabetes and predicting blood glucose concentration for hypoglycaemic episodes."}

This review aimed to assess to what extent COVID-19 clinical trials have considered the impact of race and ethnicity on COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy. Study design: This was a systematic review. Methods: Data regarding ethnicity in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials were systematically reviewed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines in this systematic review, which ran from inception until June 2021. Three international databases, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science, were used to conduct systematic article searches. Only two studies reported vaccine efficacy among ethnic minority groups. Results: The efficacy of the mRNA-1273 vaccine was confirmed to be 95% in Caucasians and 97.5% in ‘people of colour’ in a study by Baden et al. In another study by Polack et al., BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine efficacy was reported to be 95.2% in Caucasians, 100% in Afro-Caribbean or African Americans, 94.2% in Hispanic or Latinx and 95.4% in non-Hispanic, non-Latinx people. Conclusions: Given the highly differing effect of COVID-19 on the Afro-Caribbean, Hispanic and South Asian populations, it is imperative for COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials to thoroughly assess the safety and efficacy of vaccines in different ethnicities and, if necessary, develop ethnicity-specific protocols, which can minimise the disproportionate effect of COVID-19 on ethnic minority populations."}

AD disrupts neuronal pathways and thus is commonly viewed as a network disorder. Many studies demonstrate the power of functional connectivity (FC) graph-based biomarkers for automated diagnosis of AD using electroencephalography (EEG). However, various FC measures are commonly utilised, as each aims to quantify a unique aspect of brain coupling. Graph neural networks (GNN) provide a powerful framework for learning on graphs. While a growing number of studies use GNN to classify EEG brain graphs, it is unclear which method should be utilised to estimate the brain graph. We use eight FC measures to estimate FC brain graphs from sensor-level EEG signals. GNN models are trained in order to compare the performance of the selected FC measures. Additionally, three baseline models based on literature are trained for comparison. We show that GNN models perform significantly better than the other baseline models. Moreover, using FC measures to estimate brain graphs improves the performance of GNN compared to models trained using a fixed graph based on the spatial distance between the EEG sensors. However, no FC measure performs consistently better than the other measures. The best GNN reaches 0.984 area under sensitivity-specificity curve (AUC) and 92% accuracy, whereas the best baseline model, a convolutional neural network, has 0.924 AUC and 84.7% accuracy."}

Previous denoising methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown improvements in the quality of low-dose X-ray fluoroscopy images but may compromise clinically important details required by cardiologists. Methods: In order to obtain denoised X-ray fluoroscopy images whilst preserving details, we propose a novel deep-learning-based denoising framework, namely edge-enhancement densenet (EEDN), in which an attention-awareness edge-enhancement module is designed to increase edge sharpness. In this framework, a CNN-based denoiser is first used to generate an initial denoising result. Contours representing edge information are then extracted using an attention block and a group of interacted ultra-dense blocks for edge feature representation. Finally, the initial denoising result and enhanced edges are combined to generate the final X-ray image. The proposed denoising framework was tested on a total of 3262 clinical images taken from 100 low-dose X-ray sequences acquired from 20 patients. The performance was assessed by pairwise voting from five cardiologists as well as quantitative indicators. Furthermore, we evaluated our technique's effect on catheter detection using 416 images containing coronary sinus catheters in order to examine its influence as a pre-processing tool. Results: The average signal-to-noise ratio of X-ray images denoised with EEDN was 24.5, which was 2.2 times higher than that of the original images. The accuracy of catheter detection from EEDN denoised sequences showed no significant difference compared with their original counterparts. Moreover, EEDN received the highest average votes in our clinician assessment when compared to our existing technique and the original images. Conclusion: The proposed deep learning-based framework shows promising capability for denoising interventional X-ray fluoroscopy images. The results from the catheter detection show that the network does not affect the results of such an algorithm when used as a pre-processing step. The extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations suggest that the network may be of benefit to reduce radiation dose when applied in real time in the catheter laboratory."}

Assuming that the sequential data derives from the discretisation of the solution to an underlying PDE, the differential RBF network learns constant linear coefficients of the PDE, consequently regularising the RBF network by following modified backward-Euler updates. We experimentally validate the differential RBF network on the logistic map chaotic timeseries as well as on 30 real-world timeseries provided by Walmart in the M5 forecasting competition. The proposed model is compared with the normalised and unnormalised RBF networks, ARIMA, and ensembles of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and recurrent networks with long short-term memory (LSTM) blocks. From the experimental results, RBF-DiffNet consistently shows a marked reduction in the prediction error over the baseline RBF network (e.g., 41% reduction in the root mean squared scaled error on the M5 dataset, and 53% reduction in the mean absolute error on the logistic map); RBF-DiffNet also shows a comparable performance to the LSTM ensemble but requires 99% less computational time. Our proposed network consequently enables more accurate predictions—in the presence of observational noise—in sequence modelling tasks such as timeseries forecasting that leverage the model interpretability, fast training, and function approximation properties of the RBF network."}

Because the changes caused by SA on the ECG are imperceptible, the need for new methods in diagnosing this disease is required more than ever. Machine Learning (ML) is recognized as one of the most successful methods of computer aided diagnosis. ML uses new methods to diagnose diseases using past clinical results. The purpose of this study is to evaluate studies using ML algorithms based on ECG characteristics to assess people suffering from SA. In this study, systematically-reviewed articles written in English before October 2020 and indexed in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE databases were searched with no lower time limit. From these articles, 48 were selected for further review. The selected articles adopteddifferent ML methods for classification. All of these studies were binary where SA was detected from the normal state based on a full ECG stripe (per record), or based on one-minute segments (per segment). Our analysis show that the most common features used in the studies were frequency, time series, and statistical features. Support-Vector Machine (SVM) and deep learning-based neural network (i.e. CNN, DNN) performed best in full record data detection. The highest accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity reported among the selected studies were 100%, which was obtained by an SVM. In another study, the classification was conducted based on ECG segments, and accordingly, the highest classification accuracy was observed in the residual neural network algorithm (RNN). The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of this algorithm were reported to be 99%. In general, it can be stated that ML techniques based on ECG characteristics have a high capability in diagnosing SA. These techniques can increase the diagnosis of patients with SA or the detection of SA episodes on ECG record, and can potentially prevent complications of the disease at later stages."}

These models are then assessed across several criteria, i.e. ease of identifying the type of gene regulation, the predictive capability, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the robustness to parameter uncertainty to determine its viability of balancing between biological complexity and accuracy when modelling the pathogen-infected plant GRN. Using our defined ranking score, we obtain the following insights to the modelling of GRN. Our analyses show that despite commonly used and provide biological relevance, the Hill Function model ranks the lowest while the extended S-System model ranks highest in the overall comparison.

The past two decades have witnessed many computerised algorithms working on various citation function datasets tailored to various annotation schemes. Recently, deep learning has pushed the state of the art by a large margin. Several pitfalls exist. Due to annotation difficulty, data sizes, especially the minority classes, are often not big enough for training effective deep learning models. Being less discussed, most state-of-the-art deep learning solutions in fact generate a feature representation for the citation sentence or context, instead of modelling individual in-text citations. This is conceptually flawed as it is common to see multiple in-text citations with different functions in the same citation sentence. In addition, existing deep learning studies have only explored a rather limited design space of encoding citation and its surrounding context. This paper explored a wide range of modelling options based on SciBERT, the popular cross-disciplinary pre-trained scientific language model, and their performances on citation function classification, for the purpose of determining the most effective way of modeling citation and its context. To deal with the data size issue, we created a large-scale citation function dataset by mapping, merging and re-annotating six publicly available datasets from the computational linguistics domain by adapting Teufel et al.'s 12-class scheme. The best F1 scores we achieved were around 66.16%, 71.39% and 73.56% on a 11-class annotation scheme slightly adapted from Teufel et al.'s 12-class scheme, a reduced 7-class scheme by merging comparison functions, and Jurgens et al.'s 6-class scheme respectively. A useful observation is that there is no single best model that is superior for all functions, therefore the trained model variants allow for applications which emphasise on a specific type of or a specific group of citation functions."}

The first challenge is to find related and comparable articles\nfor the research. Comparative citations compare co-cited papers in a citation sentence and can serve as good guidance for researchers to track a research area. We thus go through\ncomparative citations to find comparable objects and build a comparative scientific summarization corpus (CSSC). And then, we propose the comparative graph-based summarization\n(CGSUM) method to create comparative summaries using citations as guidance. The comparative graph is constructed using sentences as nodes and three different relationships of sentences\nas edges. The relationship that sentences occur in the same paper is used to calculate the salience of sentences, the relationship that sentences occur in two different papers is used to calculate the difference between sentences, and the relationship that sentences are related to citations is used to calculate the commonality of\nsentences. Experiments show that CGSUM outperforms\ncomparative baselines on CSSC and performs well on DUC2006 and DUC2007."}

Accessible and non-invasive methods of diagnosing and characterising AD are therefore urgently required. Electroencephalography (EEG) fulfils these criteria and is often used when studying AD. Several features derived from EEG were shown to predict AD with high accuracy, e.g. signal complexity and synchronisation. However, the dynamics of how the brain transitions between stable states have not been properly studied in the case of AD and EEG. Energy landscape analysis is a method that can be used to quantify these dynamics. This work presents the first application of this method to both AD and EEG. Energy landscape assigns energy value to each possible state, i.e. pattern of activations across brain regions. The energy is inversely proportional to the probability of occurrence. By studying the features of energy landscapes of 20 AD patients and 20 age-matched healthy counterparts (HC), significant differences are found. The dynamics of AD patients' EEG are shown to be more constrained - with more local minima, less variation in basin size, and smaller basins. We show that energy landscapes can predict AD with high accuracy, performing significantly better than baseline models. Moreover, these findings are replicated in a separate dataset including 9 AD and 10 HC above 70 years old."}

Neurologists often use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose the type of brain tumor. Automated computer-assisted tools can help them speed up the diagnosis process and reduce the burden on the health care systems. Recent advances in deep learning for medical imaging have shown remarkable results, especially in the automatic and instant diagnosis of various cancers. However, we need a large amount of data (images) to train the deep learning models in order to obtain good results. Large public datasets are rare in medicine. This paper proposes a framework based on unsupervised deep generative neural networks to solve this limitation. We combine two generative models in the proposed framework: Variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs). We swap the encoder–decoder network after initially training it on the training set of available MR images. The output of this swapped network is a noise vector that has information of the image manifold, and the cascaded generative adversarial network samples the input from this informative noise vector instead of random Gaussian noise. The proposed method helps the GAN to avoid mode collapse and generate realistic-looking brain tumor magnetic resonance images. These artificially generated images could solve the limitation of small medical datasets up to a reasonable extent and help the deep learning models perform acceptably. We used the ResNet50 as a classifier, and the artificially generated brain tumor images are used to augment the real and available images during the classifier training. We compared the classification results with several existing studies and state-of-the-art machine learning models. Our proposed methodology noticeably achieved better results. By using brain tumor images generated artificially by our proposed method, the classification average accuracy improved from 72.63% to 96.25%. For the most severe class of brain tumor, glioma, we achieved 0.769, 0.837, 0.833, and 0.80 values for recall, specificity, precision, and F1-score, respectively. The proposed generative model framework could be used to generate medical images in any domain, including PET (positron emission tomography) and MRI scans of various parts of the body, and the results show that it could be a useful clinical tool for medical experts."}

Linear FC measures have been applied to study the differences in AD by splitting neurophysiological signals such as electroencephalography (EEG) recordings into discrete frequency\nbands and analysing them in isolation. We address this limitation by quantifying cross-frequency FC in addition to the traditional within-band approach. Cross-bispectrum, a higher-order spectral analysis, is used to measure the nonlinear FC and is compared with the cross-spectrum, which only measures the linear FC within bands. Each frequency coupling is then used to construct an FC network, which is in turn vectorised and used to train a classifier. We show that fusing features from networks improves classification accuracy. Although both within-frequency and cross-frequency networks can be used to predict AD with high accuracy, our results show that bispectrum-based FC outperforms cross-spectrum suggesting an important role of cross-frequency FC."}

Considering the perishable nature of fresh food products and their short life cycle, fresh food companies feel immense pressure to adopt an efficient and proactive risk management system. The risk management aspects within the food supply chains have been addressed in several studies. However, only a few studies focus on the complex interactions between the various types of risks impacting food supply chain functionality and dynamic feedback effects, which can generate a reliable risk management system. This paper strives to contribute to this evident research gap by adopting a system dynamics modelling approach to generate a systemic risk management model. The system dynamics model serves as the basis for the simulation of risk index values and can be explored in future work to further analyse the dynamic risk’s effect on the food supply chain system’s behaviour. According to a literature review of published research from 2017 to 2021, nine different risks across the food supply chain were identified as a subsection of the major risk categories: macro-level and operational risks. Following this stage, two of the risk groups identified first were integrated with a developed system dynamics model to conduct this research and to evaluate the interaction between the risks and the functionality of the three main dairy supply chain processes: production, logistics, and retailing. The key findings drawn from this paper can be beneficial for enhancing managerial discernment regarding the critical role of system dynamics models for analysing various types of risks across the food supply chain process and improving its efficiency."}

As a result, moving to Level-4 and Level-5 autonomy in the near future is starting to look like a certain possibility. Use of AI in vehicles and, in particular, cutting-edge computer vision, signal processing and control techniques have contributed significantly to the high-tech nature of state-of-the-art Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) available in cars today. In modern automobiles, AI not only contributes substantially to systems such as ADAS, but also in the areas of vehicles’ connectivity, automotive cybersecurity, and smart road infrastructure development. The next generation driverless vehicles will be completely reliant on these technologies to transport passengers and goods from one place to other, whilst eliminating human intervention entirely. However, despite the many advancements in AI for connected and autonomous vehicles done so far, there are several issues that are responsible of holding back the wide-scale deployment of AI based autonomous vehicles on roads, which are discussed in this editorial paper. Until and unless these critical issues are addressed, it would be difficult to indicate an accurate future moment in time when autonomous vehicles will become a reality globally."}

However, most intelligent data-driven diagnostic systems are not able to handle missing data. The presence of high-dimensional feature sets can also further complicate the process of fault diagnosis. This paper aims to devise a missing data imputation unit along with a dimensionality reduction unit in the pre-processing module of the diagnostic system. This paper proposes a novel pooling strategy for missing data imputation (PSMI). This strategy can simplify complex patterns of missingness and incrementally update the pool. The pre-processing module receives incomplete observations, PSMI estimates missing values, and, then, the dimensionality reduction unit transforms completed observations onto a lower-dimensional feature space. These transformed observations are then fed as inputs to the fault classification module for decision making and diagnosis. This diagnostic scheme makes use of various state-of-the-art missing data imputation, dimensionality reduction and classification algorithms. This enables a comprehensive comparison and allows to find the best techniques for the sake of diagnosing faults in the Tennessee Eastman process. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed pooling strategy and indicate that principal component analysis imputation and heteroscedastic discriminant analysis approaches outperform other imputation and dimensionality reduction techniques in this diagnostic application."}

In this algorithm, the Gaussian distribution is employed to generate the sequence of random numbers in the QPSO algorithm. By decreasing the variance of the Gaussian distribution linearly, the algorithm is able not only to maintain its global search ability during the early search stages, but can also obtain gradually enhanced local search ability in the later search stages. Additionally, a weighted mean best position in the IG-QPSO is employed to achieve a good balance between local search and global search. The proposed algorithm and some other well-known PSO variants are tested on ten standard benchmark functions and six well-studied engineering shape design problems. Experimental results show that the IG-QPSO algorithm can optimize these problems effectively in terms of precision and robustness compared to its competitors."}

However, most of the optimization search algorithms used in popular docking software are far from being ideal in the first case, and they can hardly be directly utilized for the latter case due to the relatively large search area. In order to design an algorithm that can flexibly adapt to different sizes of the search area, we propose an effective swarm intelligence optimization algorithm in this paper, called diversity-controlled Lamarckian quantum particle swarm optimization (DCL-QPSO). The highlights of the algorithm are a diversity-controlled strategy and a modified local search method. Integrated with the docking environment of Autodock, the DCL-QPSO is compared with Autodock Vina, Glide and other two Autodock-based search algorithms for flexible ligand docking. Experimental results revealed that the proposed algorithm has a performance comparable to those of Autodock Vina and Glide for dockings within a certain area around the binding sites, and is a more effective solver than all the compared methods for dockings without prior knowledge of the binding sites."}

However, all the previously studied variants assume that vehicles are mostly the same in terms of their capacity, location and home location (depot). This study uses the agent-based approach for solving VRPTW with vehicle's unique location and depot. This is to minimise the number of used vehicles as the main target. Other targets including total distance travelled, waiting time and time are also considered as criteria to evaluate the quality of the generated vehicle routes. This is achieved by proposing a Messaging Protocol-based Heuristics Optimisation (MPHO) model that balances between centrally-distributed agents' interactions and accommodates certain priority rules specifically developed for the problem. Furthermore, modifications to certain constraints checking techniques are introduced by implementing time Push Forward (PF) checking recursively tailored to the route's unique start/ending locations as well as calculating the reduced waiting time to find and check the limit of the total route duration. In order to justify the superiority of the proposed MPHO model, numerical tests have been conducted on benchmark problems including single and multiple depot instances as well as modified instances tailored to the problem. This is made possible by randomising vehicles' capacities and their unique locations and depots. Key results reveal that, in multiple depot instances, higher quality solutions compared with previous benchmark outcomes are obtained in terms of minimising the total number of vehicles along with fastest solution time (CPU) at the expense of total time and distance travelled."}

The early detection of cervical cancer is done relatively by using the Pap Smear cell Test. This method of detection is challenged by the degradation phenomenon within the image segmentation task that arises when the superpixel count is minimized. This paper introduces a Hybrid Linear Iterative Clustering and Bayes classification-based GrabCut Segmentation Technique (HLC-BC-GCST) for the dynamic detection of Cervical cancer. In this proposed HLC-BC-GCST approach, the Linear Iterative Clustering process is employed to cluster the potential features of the preprocessed image, which is then combined with GrabCut to prevent the issues that arise when the number of superpixels is minimized. In addition, the proposed HLC-BC-GCST scheme benefits of the advantages of the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) on the extracted features from the iterative clustering method, based on which the mapping is performed to describe the energy function. Then, Bayes classification is used for reconstructing the graph cut model from the extracted energy function derived from the GMM model-based Linear Iterative Clustering features for better computation and implementation. Finally, the boundary optimization method is utilized to considerably minimize the roughness of cervical cells, which contains the cytoplasm and nuclei regions, using the GrabCut algorithm to facilitate improved segmentation accuracy. The results of the proposed HLC-BC-GCST scheme are 6% better than the results obtained by other standard detection approaches of cervical cancer using graph cuts."}

Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are most commonly used to accomplish this task because of their ability to accurately locate the vehicle in the environment. However, recent publications have revealed serious cases where GNSS fails miserably to determine the position of the vehicle, for example, under a bridge, in a tunnel, or in dense forests. In this work, we propose a framework architecture of explaining deep learning LiDAR-based (XDLL) models that predicts the position of the vehicles by using only a few LiDAR points in the environment, which ensures the required fastness and accuracy of interactions between vehicle components. The proposed framework extracts non-semantic features from LiDAR scans using a clustering algorithm. The identified clusters serve as input to our deep learning model, which relies on LSTM and GRU layers to store the trajectory points and convolutional layers to smooth the data. The model has been extensively tested with short- and long-term trajectories from two benchmark datasets, Kitti and NCLT, containing different environmental scenarios. Moreover, we investigated the obtained results by explaining the contribution of each cluster feature by using several explainable methods, including Saliency, SmoothGrad, and VarGrad. The analysis showed that taking the mean of all the clusters as an input for the model is enough to obtain better accuracy compared to the first model, and it reduces the time consumption as well. The improved model is able to obtain a mean absolute positioning error of below one meter for all sequences in the short- and long-term trajectories."}

We show that by increasing the migration rate, there are more bifurcation sequences than previous works showed. In particular, the number of steady states can change from 9 (small migration) to 3 (large migration) at a single bifurcation point, or via a sequence of bifurcations with the system having 9, 7, 5, 3 steady states or 9, 7, 9, 3 steady states, depending on the Allee threshold. This is in contrast with the case of bidirectional migration, where the number of steady states always goes through the same bifurcation sequence of 9, 5, 3 steady states as we increase the migration rate, regardless of the value of the Allee threshold. These results have practical implications as well in spatial ecology."}

While wrist-worn sensing devices have garnered significant interest, their value for daily practice is still unclear. In this narrative review, we survey demographic, clinical and technological information from 39 articles across four public databases. Wrist-worn technology mainly monitors motor symptoms and sleep disorders of patients in daily life. We find that accelerometers are the most commonly used sensors to measure the movement of people living with PD.

The emerging field of graph signal processing (GSP) promises to analyse dynamic characteristics of multivariate signals, while at the same time taking the network, or spatial structure between the signals into account. To do so, GSP decomposes the multivariate signals into graph frequency signals, which are ordered by their magnitude. However, the meaning of the graph frequencies in terms of this ordering remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role the ordering plays in preserving valuable dynamic structures in the signals, with neuroimaging applications in mind. In order to overcome the limitations in sample size common to neurophysiological data sets, we introduce a minimalist simulation framework to generate arbitrary amounts of data. Using this artificial data, we find that lower graph frequency signals are less suitable for classifying neurophysiological data than higher graph frequency signals. We further introduce a baseline testing framework for GSP. Using this framework, we conclude that dynamic, or spectral structures are poorly preserved in GSP, high-lighting current limitations of GSP for neuroimaging."}

By considering stochas- tic noise in the turbulence and zonal flows as well as constant and time-varying input power Q, we perform multiple stochastic simulations of over a million trajectories using GPU computing. Due to stochastic noise, some trajectories undergo the L-H transition while others do not, leading to a mixture of H-mode and dithering at a given time and/or input power. One of the consequences of this is that H-mode characteristics appear at a smaller input power Q < Qc (where Qc is the critical value for the L-H transition in the deterministic system) as a secondary peak of a probability density function (PDF) while dithering characteristics persists beyond the power threshold for Q > Qc as a second peak. The coexisting H-mode and dithering near Q = Qc leads to a prominent bimodal PDF with a gradual L-H transition rather than a sudden transition at Q = Qc and uncertainty in the input power. Also, a time-dependent input power leads to increased variability (dispersion) in stochastic trajectories and a more prominent bimodal PDF. We provide an interpretation of the results using information geometry to elucidate self-regulation between zonal flows, turbulence, and information causality rate to unravel causal relations involved in the L-H transition."}

The approach effectively overcomes the limitations of traditional pixel-based classifiers by integrating spectral and spatial information to achieve improved classification results. Specifically, the proposed method uses principal component analysis to transform the HS images and the Naive Bayes (NB) classifier to quickly derive spectral-posterior probabilities. Spatial-posterior probabilities are then computed using an adaptive fast Fourier transform (AFFT) and a probabilistic closeness function. These probabilities are then combined to generate a precise SSC map. The proposed approach is available in two distinct styles: the conventional NB-AFFT-SSC method and the proposed iterationwise variable sequencing based NB-AFFT-SSC (IVS-NB-AFFT-SSC) method, which classifies one designated class in each iteration. In addition, two wrapper-based feature selection methods are proposed to obtain a set of principal components (PCs) for each class of the HS image, significantly improving classification accuracy. The approach's efficacy is demonstrated through extensive experimentation on three real HS datasets, including Washington DC Mall, Salinas-A, and Botswana. The generality of the approach has been proven through the use of other well-known machine-learning algorithms, such as support vector machine and K-nearest neighbor, as wrappers in the approach. The results confirm that the proposed approach is highly effective, with the IVS approach helping users concentrate on a particular set of PCs for the class of interest."}

However, like other PSO variants, it often suffers a premature convergence, especially when solving complex optimization problems. Considering this issue, this paper proposes a hybrid QPSO with dynamic grouping searching strategy, named QPSO-DGS. During the search process, the particle swarm is dynamically grouped into two subpopulations, which are assigned to implement the exploration and exploitation search, respectively. In each subpopulation, a comprehensive learning strategy is used for each particle to adjust its personal best position with a certain probability. Besides, a modified opposition-based computation is employed to improve the swarm diversity. The experimental comparison is conducted between the QPSO-DGS and other seven state-of-art PSO variants on the CEC’2013 test suit. The experimental results show that QPSO-DGS has a promising performance in terms of the solution accuracy and the convergence speed on the majority of these test functions, and especially on multimodal problems."}

These tasks usually require a high-fidelity human body mesh in a canonical posture (e.g., &#x2018;A&#x2019; pose or &#x2018;T&#x2019; pose). Although 3D scanning technology is fast and popular for acquiring the subject&#x0027;s body shape, automatically normalizing the posture of scanned bodies is still under-researched. Existing methods highly rely on skeleton-driven animation technologies. However, these methods require carefully-designed skeleton and skin weights, which is time-consuming and fails when the initial posture is complicated. In this work, a novel deep learning-based approach, dubbed PoseNormNet, is proposed to automatically normalize the postures of scanned bodies. The proposed algorithm provides strong operability since it does not require any rigging priors and works well for subjects in arbitrary postures.

Traditional body volume estimation techniques such as underwater weighing and air displacement demand a lot of equipment, and are difficult to be performed under some circumstances, e.g. in clinical environments when dealing with bedridden patients. In this contribution, a novel vision-based method dubbed Point2PartVolume based on deep learning is proposed to rapidly and accurately predict the part-aware body volumes from a single depth image of the dressed body. Firstly, a novel multi-task neural network is proposed for jointly completing the partial body point clouds, predicting the body shape under clothing, and semantically segmenting the reconstructed body into parts. Next, the estimated body segments are fed into the proposed volume regression network to estimate the partial volumes. A simple yet efficient two-step training strategy is proposed for improving the accuracy of volume prediction regressed from point clouds. Compared to existing methods, the proposed method addresses several major challenges in vision-based human body volume estimation, including shape completion, pose estimation, body shape estimation under clothing, body segmentation, and volume regression from point clouds. Experimental results on both the synthetic data and public real-world data show our method achieved average 90% volume prediction accuracy and outperformed the relevant state-of-the-art."}

LED lights are often used in this type of farming to increase plant yield. LED lights are dc load, whereas the grid provides ac power.

This paper proposes an innovative control method for the boost PFC converter, where an advanced phase-locked loop scheme is developed that can eliminate measurement dc offset and provide harmonic robust estimation of the grid voltage fundamental component. The applied nonlinear control uses the existing two-loop control architecture. Based on a baseline PI controller, a nonlinear function is added to make the controller react faster when it is far from the reference and vice-versa. Comprehensive simulation studies are conducted to assess the performance of the proposed method under various challenging test scenarios. Compared to the baseline method, the proposed technique achieved 42%∼65% reduction in total harmonic distortion depending on the test cases, which makes the technique a suitable candidate for improving the operational efficiency and, consequently, the running cost of a smart farming lighting system on an industrial scale. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed method over the conventional counterpart."}

Nevertheless, simulation of such dynamics is faced with computational and time constraints, given the nonlinear and complex nature of the problem, which could become a bottleneck for large-scale applications. The recent advances in machine learning, specifically, in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), have gained much attention due to the potential to provide fast and accurate results, while preserving the binding physics laws and requiring small amounts of data in contrast to other neural networks. In this sense, such networks encode the physics equations into the neural network, and the latter must fit the noisy observed data whilst minimising the equation residual. This study investigates the application of PINNs to quantify the capacity of mangrove environments to attenuate waves and prevent erosion, and represents the first application of PINNs to model vegetation for a large-scale geographical domain with complex boundary conditions. Navier–Stokes, the broadly used mathematical equation to solve for fluid dynamics, is used as the governing equation that constrains the neural network to respect the conservation of mass, energy, and momentum. The Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest in the world located between India and Bangladesh, is taken as a case study. The results demonstrate that the developed model is superior when compared to a numerical finite element model, in terms of time and data efficiency, yet produces equally strong overall results."}

Traditional 3-D hand scanning requires multiple scans taken around the hand with a 3-D scanning device. These methods require the patients to keep an open-palm posture during scanning, which is painful or even impossible for patients with impaired hand functions. Once multi-view partial point clouds are collected, expensive post-processing is necessary to generate a high-fidelity hand shape. To address these limitations, we propose a novel deep-learning method dubbed PatientHandNet to reconstruct high-fidelity hand shapes in a canonical open-palm pose from multiple-depth images acquired with a single-depth camera. The hand poses in the depth images may vary, hand movements are allowed, facilitating the 3-D scanning process in particular for patients with difficult conditions. The proposed method has strong operability since it is insensitive to the input pose, allowing for pose variations in the input depth images. We also proposed two novel datasets: a large-scale synthetic dataset to train our model and a real-world dataset with ground-truth hand biometrics extracted by an experienced anthropometrist. Extensive experimental results on the unseen synthetic data and real-world data demonstrate that the proposed method provides robust and easy-to-use hand shape reconstruction and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in biometric accuracy terms."}

The Kernel-Adatron family of algorithms, gaining attention recently, has allowed us to handle very large classification and regression problems. However, these methods treat different types of samples (i.e., noise, border, and core) in the same manner, which makes these algorithms search in unpromising areas and increases the number of iterations as well. This paper introduces a hybrid method to overcome such shortcomings, called the Optimal Recurrent Neural Network and Density-Based Support Vector Machine (Opt-RNN-DBSVM). This method consists of four steps: (a) the characterization of different samples, (b) the elimination of samples with a low probability of being a support vector, (c) the construction of an appropriate recurrent neural network to solve the dual-DBSVM based on an original energy function, and (d) finding the solution to the system of differential equations that govern the dynamics of the RNN, using the Euler–Cauchy method involving an optimal time step. Density-based preprocessing reduces the number of local minima in the dual-SVM. The RNN’s recurring architecture avoids the need to explore recently visited areas. With the optimal time step, the search moves from the current vectors to the best neighboring support vectors. It is demonstrated that RNN-SVM converges to feasible support vectors and Opt-RNN-DBSVM has very low time complexity compared to the RNN-SVM with a constant time step and the Kernel-Adatron algorithm–SVM. Several classification performance measures are used to compare Opt-RNN-DBSVM with different classification methods and the results obtained show the good performance of the proposed method."}

In this paper, we propose a novel method to produce a sparse kernel matrix using the compact support radial kernels (CSRKs) to efficiently learn the GPR from large datasets. The CSRKs can effectively avoid the ill-conditioned and full kernel matrix during GPR training and prediction, consequently reducing computational costs and memory requirements. In practice, the interest in CSRKs waned slightly as it became evident that, there is a trade-off principle (conflict between accuracy and sparsity) for compactly supported kernels. Hence, when using kernels with compact support, during GPR training, the main focus will be on providing a high level of accuracy. In this case, the advantage of achieving a sparse covariance matrix for CSRKs will almost disappear, as we will see in the numerical results. This trade-off has led authors to search for an “optimal” value of the scale parameter. Accordingly, by selecting the suitable priors on the kernel hyperparameters, and simply estimating the hyperparameters using a modified version of the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), the GPR model derived from the CSRKs yields maximal accuracy while still maintaining a sparse covariance matrix. In fact, in GPR training, modified version of the MLE will be proportional to the product of MLE and a given suitable prior distribution for the hyperparameters that provides an efficient method for learning. The misspecification of prior distributions and their impact on the predictability of the sparse GPR models are also comprehensively investigated using several empirical studies. The proposed new approach is applied to some irregular domains with noisy test functions in 2D data sets in a comparative study. We finally investigate the effect of prior on the predictability of GPR models based on the real dataset. The derived results suggest the proposed method leads to more sparsity and well-conditioned kernel matrices in all cases."}

Compartment-based mathematical control models for diabetes usually result in objective functions whose terms are conflicting, preventing the use of single-objective-based models for obtaining appropriate personalized strategies. Taking into account the conflicting aspects when controlling the diabetic population dynamics, this paper introduces a multi-objective approach consisting of four steps: (a) modeling the problem of controlling the diabetic population dynamics using a multi-objective mathematical model, (b) discretizing the model using the trapezoidal rule and the Euler–Cauchy method, (c) using swarm-intelligence-based optimizers to solve the model and (d) structuring the set of controls using soft clustering methods, known for their flexibility. In contrast to single-objective approaches, experimental results show that the multi-objective approach obtains appropriate personalized controls, where the control associated with the compartment of diabetics without complications is totally different from that associated with the compartment of diabetics with complications. Moreover, these controls enable a significant reduction in the number of diabetics with and without complications, and the multi-objective strategy saves up to 4% of the resources needed for the control of diabetes without complications and up to 18% of resources for the control of diabetes with complications."}

However, most of the previous studies focused on the development of theoretical models and practical strategies that scholars can employ to attract diverse populations to their citizen science (CS) projects. Their findings were mostly based on either conceptual ethical frameworks or empirical observations of the scholars after the completion of the specific CS project. Few studies collected socio-demographic and behavioral data of the active citizens involved in a CS project to analyze the diversity of citizens in CS. However, to the best of our knowledge, having reviewed numerous peer-reviewed papers, none of the previous studies attempted to use prospective citizen scientists’ traits to investigate intrinsic factors that may help increase the active engagement and diversity in CS. This paper presents a new inclusive citizen science engagement model based on quantitative analysis of surveys administered to 540 participants of the dedicated free informal education course ‘Your Right to Privacy Online’ (MOOC - a massive online open course) from eight countries in the EU funded project, CSI-COP (Citizen Scientists Investigating Cookies and App GDPR compliance). The surveys were filled out just after completing the training stage and before joining the project as active citizen scientists. Out of the 540 participants who completed the surveys analyzed in this study, only 170 (32%) individuals actively participated as citizen scientists in the project. Therefore, the study attempted to understand what characterizes these participants compared to those who decided to refrain from joining the project after the training stage. This study’s findings revealed several important relationships and predictors for becoming a citizen scientist based on the surveys analysis, such as age, gender, culture, education, Internet accessibility and apps usage, as well as the satisfaction with the MOOC, the mode of training and initial intentions for becoming a citizen scientist. These findings lead to the development of the empirical model for inclusive engagement in CS and enhance the understanding of the internal factors that influence individuals' intention and actual participation as citizen scientists. The devised model offers valuable insights for designing inclusive recruitment strategies, fostering positive learning experiences, addressing technological barriers, bridging the intention-engagement gap, and tailoring engagement strategies to accommodate ethnic and cultural diversity."}

Unfortunately, its major drawback is its asymptotic behavior where the prior to posterior convergence in terms of the standard metrics (and also computed by Fréchet derivative) used as a local sensitivity measure is not appropriate. The constructed local sensitivity measures do not converge to zero, and even diverge for the most multidimensional classes of prior distributions. Restricting the classes of priors or using other (Formula presented.) -divergence metrics have been proposed as the ways to resolve this issue which were not successful. We overcome this issue, by proposing a new flexible class of metrics so-called credible metrics whose asymptotic behavior is far more promising and no restrictions are required to impose. Using these metrics, the stability of Bayesian inference to the structure of the prior distribution will be then investigated. Under appropriate condition, we present a uniform bound in a sense that a close credible metric a priori will give a close credible metric a posteriori. As a result, we do not get the sort of divergence based on other metrics. We finally show that the posterior predictive distributions are more stable and robust."}

To address this problem, we propose a user-friendly and fast method dubbed Measure4DHand, which automatically extracts dynamic hand measurements from a sequence of depth images captured by a single depth camera.

A novel synthetic dataset consisting of 234K hands in various shapes and poses, along with their corresponding ground truth landmarks, is proposed for training the proposed methods.

Classification results are compared with other commonly used FC measures. Our analysis shows significant differences in FC between bipolar channels of the occipital region and other regions (i.e. parietal, centro-parietal, and fronto-central) between AD and HC groups. Furthermore, our results indicate that FC changes between channels along the fronto-parietal region and the rest of the EEG are important in diagnosing AD.

Unlike the data of the key press or release, our dataset not only captures the velocity of pressing and releasing different keys and the typing style of specific keys or combinations of keys but also contains rich information on the hand shape and posture. To verify the validity of our proposed data, we adopt deep neural networks to learn distinguishing features from different data representations, including RGB-KD-Net, D-KD-Net and RGBD-KD-Net. Simultaneously, the sequence of point clouds also can be obtained from depth images given the intrinsic parameters of the RGB-D sensor, so we also study the performance of human identification based on the point clouds. Extensive experimental results show that our idea works and the performance of the proposed method based on RGB-D images is the best, which achieved 99.44% accuracy based on the unseen real-world data. To inspire more researchers and facilitate relevant studies, the proposed dataset will be publicly accessible together with the publication of this paper."}

The data provided by such technology can estimate the bioenergy source production rate and monitor deforestation. This work participates in the cause by contributing an aerial dataset and developing an intelligent tree-detection system usable for counting trees with the bioenergy potential. Low-altitude flying units have been vastly used for such a purpose due to their ability to capture high-quality data from distant locations. Despite these potentials, collected images that compose a dataset are often characterized by imbalanced distribution among classes. The class disproportion can affect the overall model performance, as it severely deprives key features of under-represented classes. This study proposes data-level approaches that adopt and extend prior sampling algorithms for object detection problems. The devised techniques try to reduce the number of redundant outputs obtained from sampling methods and reduce the iteration required to achieve the target imbalance ratio by employing a systematic flow. In such a process, the class distribution of an original dataset is used as a guideline for selecting candidates for subsequent processes. Our results show that the modified dataset can reduce the length of a training process shown by fewer iterations required to achieve the final metrics of its original dataset version and lower training losses in each iteration. Additionally, the modified dataset can improve the F-score (F1) and precision metric of object detection algorithm by up to 6%."}

Nevertheless, simulating such dynamics is faced with computational and time complexities, given the nonlinear and complex nature of the problem, which could become a bottleneck for large-scale applications. This study investigates the effect of mangrove environments on the hydro-morphodynamics of its region. A depth-averaged model was built using a novel finite element model for simulating coastal models, within Thetis. The Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest in the world located between India and Bangladesh, is taken as a case study. The Sundarbans is regularly subjected to tropical cyclones, the impacts of which endanger the lives of the region’s four million people. This is a first-time application of a coupled hydro-morphodyamic model using discontinuous Galerkin finite element discretisation for modelling mangrove environments in a real-world application. A wetting drying scheme was implemented in the models in order to avoid numerical instabilities. The effect of mangrove environments is demonstrated ,by imposing a periodic tidal boundary, conditions using TPXO tidal solver, using experiments with and without mangroves. The model is validated against the results of another study on the same region and tidal gauge data. Mangrove environments are able to decrease water elevations and velocities by more than 97%, and prevent almost any sediment erosion when compared with the experiment with no mangroves."}

Hybrid systems based on different soft computing approaches with complementary qualities and principles have also become popular. On the one hand, fuzzy logic makes its decisions on the basis of the degree of membership but gives no information on the frequency of an event; on the other hand, the probability informs us of the frequency of the event but gives no information on the degree of membership to a set. In this work, we propose a new measure that implements both fuzzy and probabilistic notions (i.e., the degree of membership and the frequency) while exploiting the ability of the convolution operator to combine functions on continuous intervals. This measure evaluates both the degree of membership and the frequency of objects/events in the design of decision support systems. We show, using concrete examples, the drawbacks of fuzzy logic and probability-based approaches taken separately, and we then show how a fuzzy probabilistic convolution measure allows the correction of these drawbacks. Based on this measure, we introduce a new clustering method named Fuzzy-Probabilistic-Convolution-C-Means (FP-Conv-CM). Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), Probabilistic K-Means (PKM), and FP-Conv-CM were tested on multiple datasets and compared on the basis of two performance measures based on the Silhouette metric and the Dunn’s Index. FP-Conv-CM was shown to improve on both metrics. In addition, FCM, PKM, and FP-Conv-CM were used for multiple image compression tasks and were compared based on three performance measures: Mean Square Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Structural SImilarity Index (SSIM). The proposed FP-Conv-CM method shows improvements in all these three measures as well."}

Existing approaches ignored the semantic relationships between the citing and cited publications, resulting in several adverse issues, in terms of coherence of main paths and coverage of significant studies. This paper advocated the semantic main path analysis approach to alleviate these issues based on citation function analysis. A wide variety of SciBERT-based deep learning models were designed for identifying citation functions. Semantic citation networks were built by either including important citations, e.g., extension, motivation, usage and similarity, or excluding incidental citations like background and future work. Semantic main path network was built by merging the top-K main paths extracted from various time slices of semantic citation network. In addition, this study proposed a three-way framework for quantitative evaluation of main path analysis results. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis on three research areas of computational linguistics demonstrated that, compared to semantics-agnostic counterparts, different types of semantic main path networks provide complementary views scientific knowledge flows.

This search algorithm, called entropy-based Lamarckian quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (ELQPSO), is a combination of the QPSO with an entropy-based update strategy and the Solis and Wet local search (SWLS) method. By using the PDBbind core set v.2016, the ELQPSO is compared with the Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA), Lamarckian particle swarm optimization (LPSO) and Lamarckian QPSO (LQPSO). The experimental results reveal that the corresponding docking program of ELQPSO, named as EQDOCK in this paper, has a competitive performance in dealing with the protein-ligand docking problems. Moreover, for the test cases with different number of torsions, the EQDOCK outperforms the other three docking programs in finding docking conformations with small root mean squared deviation (RMSD) values in most cases.

Remote human activity recognition (HAR) is beneficial for regular monitoring of the elderly population. This paper addresses the problem of the continuous detection of daily human activities using a mm-wave Doppler radar. In this study, two strategies have been employed: the first method uses un-equalized series of activities, whereas the second method utilizes a gradient-based strategy for equalization of the series of activities. The dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm and Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) techniques have been implemented for the classification of un-equalized and equalized series of activities, respectively. The input for DTW was provided using three strategies. The first approach uses the pixel-level data of frames (UnSup-PLevel). In the other two strategies, a convolutional variational autoencoder (CVAE) is used to extract Un-Supervised Encoded features (UnSup-EnLevel) and Supervised Encoded features (Sup-EnLevel) from the series of Doppler frames. The second approach for equalized data series involves the application of four distinct feature extraction methods: i.e., convolutional neural networks (CNN), supervised and unsupervised CVAE, and principal component Analysis (PCA). The extracted features were considered as an input to the LSTM. This paper presents a comparative analysis of a novel supervised feature extraction pipeline, employing Sup-ENLevel-DTW and Sup-EnLevel-LSTM, against several state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, including UnSUp-EnLevel-DTW, UnSup-EnLevel-LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and PCA-LSTM.

By swapping the variable names in already labelled problems, we generate new problem instances that do not require any further labelling when viewing the selection as a classification problem. We find this augmentation increases the accuracy of ML models by 63% on average. We study what part of this improvement is due to the balancing of the dataset and what is achieved thanks to further increasing the size of the dataset, concluding that both have a very significant effect.

Linear FC measures have been applied to study the differences in AD by splitting neurophysiological signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, into discrete frequency bands and analysing them in isolation from each other. We address this limitation by quantifying cross-frequency FC in addition to the traditional within-band approach. Cross-bispectrum, a higher-order spectral analysis approach, is used to measure the nonlinear FC and is compared with the cross-spectrum, which only measures the linear FC within bands. This work reports the reconstruction of a cross-frequency FC network where each frequency band is treated as a layer in a multilayer network with both inter- and intra-layer edges. Cross-bispectrum detects cross-frequency differences, mainly increased FC in AD cases in δ-θ coupling. Overall, increased strength of low-frequency coupling and decreased level of high-frequency coupling is observed in AD cases in comparison to healthy controls (HC). We demonstrate that a graph-theoretic analysis of cross-frequency brain networks is crucial to obtain a more detailed insight into their structure and function. Vulnerability analysis reveals that the integration and segregation properties of networks are enabled by different frequency couplings in AD networks compared to HCs. Finally, we use the reconstructed networks for classification. The extra cross-frequency coupling information can improve the classification performance significantly, suggesting an important role of cross-frequency FC. The results highlight the importance of studying nonlinearity and including cross-frequency FC in characterising AD."}

Annotation difficulty resulted in limited data size, especially for minority classes, and inadequate representativeness of the underlying scientific domains. Concerning algorithmic classification, state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods are flawed by generating a feature vector for the whole citation context (or sentence) and failing to exploit the full realm of citation modelling options. Responding to these issues, this paper studied contextualised citation function classification. Specifically, a large new citation context dataset was created by merging and re-annotating six datasets about computational linguistics. A variety of strong SciBERT-based citation function classification models were proposed, and new states of the art were achieved. Through deeper performance analysis, this study focused on answering several research questions about the effective ways of performing citation function classification. More specifically, the study justified the necessity of modelling in-text citations in context and confirmed the superiority of doing citation function classification at citation (segment) level. A particular emphasis was placed on in-depth per-class performance analysis to understand whether citation function classification is robust enough to suit various popular downstream applications and what further efforts are required to meet such analytic needs.

These temporal signals are generally not independent of each other, but exhibit a rich spatial structure. Graph filtering, either spatial or spectral, is a method that can leverage this spatial structure for various preprocessing tasks, such as graph denoising. Previous studies have focused on learning the parameters of spatial graph impulse response (GIR) filters, while neglecting spectral graph frequency response (GFR) filters, even though GFR filters offer unique advantages in terms of regularisation and interpretation. In this study, we therefore compare learning GIR filters and GFR filters as a trainable preprocessing step for two different neural networks on an Alzheimer’s classification task. We tested both a functional connectivity graph as well as a geometric graph as the base of each filter type, and varied the localisation of the spatial filter. As expected, the retrieved shapes of the trained filters suggest that GFR filters can be interpreted in terms of their graph structure, while the same does not hold for GIR filters. Contrarily, however, we found that only the geometric, highly localised GIR filter outperforms the baseline significantly, surpassing it by 3.8 percentage points. These findings suggest that the observed performance boost of a trained localised GIR filter may in fact not be due to the graph structure. Instead, we hypothesise that this boost is caused by favourable algebraic properties of the filter matrix."}

The two most widely used methods for measuring causality are Granger Causality (GC) and Transfer Entropy (TE), which rely on measuring the improvement in the prediction of one process based on the knowledge of another process at an earlier time. However, they have their own limitations, e.g., in applications to nonlinear, non-stationary data, or non-parametric models. In this study, we propose an alternative approach to quantify causality through information geometry that overcomes such limitations. Specifically, based on the information rate that measures the rate of change of the time-dependent distribution, we develop a model-free approach called information rate causality that captures the occurrence of the causality based on the change in the distribution of one process caused by another. This measurement is suitable for analyzing numerically generated non-stationary, nonlinear data. The latter are generated by simulating different types of discrete autoregressive models which contain linear and nonlinear interactions in unidirectional and bidirectional time-series signals. Our results show that information rate causality can capture the coupling of both linear and nonlinear data better than GC and TE in the several examples explored in the paper."}

The HIQPSO-RD introduces historical information into the current mean best position of the QPSO, for the purpose of improving the convergence speed of the algorithm, by enhancing its exploration ability and preventing the premature convergence of the swarm. The proposed algorithm employs the random drift local attractor technique to make a good balance between its exploration and exploitation, so that the algorithm can find a better adversarial attack example with low grammaticality and perplexity. In addition, it employs a two-stage diversity control strategy to enhance the search performance of the algorithm. Experiments on three natural language processing (NLP) datasets, with three commonly used nature language processing models as victim models, show that our method achieves higher attack success rates and with lower modification rates than the state-of-the-art adversarial attack methods. Moreover, the results of human evaluations show that adversarial examples generated by our method can better maintain the semantic similarity and grammatical correctness of the original input."}

The procedure is a high-risk procedure and it could lead to major complications or even procedure-related death. Recently, an Electra Registry Outcome Score (EROS) was designed to create a risk assessment tool using the data about personal health records and an accuracy of 0.70 was achieved. In this paper, we hypothesized that a coil inside the superior vena cava (SVC) is a very important risk factor. By integrating it into the risk assessment model, the accuracy can be further improved. Therefore, an automatic detection method was developed to localize the positions of coils in the X-ray images. It was based on a U-Net convolutional network. To determine the coil position relative to the SVC position inside the chest X-ray image, the heart region was first detected by using a modified VGG16 model. Then, the bounding box of the SVC can be estimated based on the heart anatomy. Finally, a XGBoost classifier was trained on the data about personal health records and the risk factor about the coil position. An accuracy of 0.85 was achieved."}

In speed breeding, typically various light qualities (e.g., colour, duration, intensity) are modified to manipulate the circadian clock of the plants, which in turn alter the plant growth and enhance the productivity such as by reducing the flowering time. In order to develop a comprehensive framework describing plant growth, a model incorporating the effect of various light qualities on plant growth needs to be established. Recently a mathematical model of the plant circadian clock for Arabidopsis thaliana has been developed to characterise the hypocotyl growth subject to multiple light quality properties. This is a first step towards developing a more comprehensive model that links light quality, plant circadian clock and plant growth. In this work, we extend the model by adding the effect of various light qualities on the flowering time. The proposed model can capture the flowering time behaviours of plant when subject to red, blue, and mixed lights and can be used to guide experiment of light properties manipulation for optimised plant growth via hypocotyl growth and flowering time."}

Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (HQPSO) algorithm to alleviate the above problems. In the HQPSO, the Solis and Wets local search method is used to enhance the local search ability of the QPSO so that the algorithm can find solutions that is close to optimal when the constraints are met, and two evolution operators are proposed and incorporated for the purpose of making a better balance between local search and global search abilities at the later search stage. The performance comparison is made among the HQPSO and the other ten population-based random search methods under two different experimental configurations and four different power systems in terms of solution quality, robustness, and convergence property. The experimental results show that the HQPSO improves the convergence properties of the QPSO and finally obtains the best total generation cost without violating any constraints. In addition, the HQPSO outperforms all the other algorithms on 7 cases of all 8 experimental cases in terms of global best position and mean position, which verifies the effectiveness of the algorithm."}

Previous studies have relied on functional connectivity methods to infer brain graph structures and used simple GNN architectures for the diagnosis of AD. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive gated graph convolutional network (AGGCN) that can provide explainable predictions. AGGCN adaptively learns graph structures by combining convolution-based node feature enhancement with a correlation-based measure of power spectral density similarity. Furthermore, the gated graph convolution can dynamically weigh the contribution of various spatial scales. The proposed model achieves high accuracy in both eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions, indicating the stability of learned representations.

To ensure a low total operational cost and improve the efficiency of farming in those environments, it is imperative that the overall LED lighting system is energy efficient. LED is a dc system, whereas the grid is an ac system. As such, an LED driver is needed to perform the necessary voltage conversion. The boost power factor correction (PFC) converter is a popular LED driver that provides output voltage regulation and power factor correction at the same time. As the LED driver is grid-connected, its control system requires real-time estimation of the grid voltage parameter information for reference current generation. In this study, a comparison between frequency-and phase-locked loops as the grid detection method inside the converter control system is provided. For the phase-locked loop (PLL), a single-phase quasi-type-1 structure is considered. It is then compared with the conventional second-order generalised integrator (SOGI)frequency-locked loop (FLL). Comprehensive numerical studies are performed to evaluate the performance of FLL and PLL in challenging grid voltage cases. Results show that the source current has a lower total harmonic distortion when PLL is used as the synchronisation tool over the FLL counterpart. This can be attributed to the use of moving average filter in the PLL, which provides additional harmonic robustness compared to FLL. Lower distortion by the PLL method will the make LED driver, consequently smart farming more energy efficient."}

Within this dialogue, young people’s voices and lived experience are needed to deepen the impact of energy policy intervention strategies. This article stresses the importance of a formal curriculum that informs future generations on the subjects of Smart Local Energy Systems (SLES), and the digitalisation advances of energy systems. This paper explores the development of a toolkit to educate and engage young people in these subjects, and reviews young people’s attitudes and understanding from three schools in England, UK. We find through an interpretive qualitative analysis of both images drawn by the young people, and insights gathered from focus groups, that i) for these young people, SLES are a useful innovation regarding energy management and distribution, ii) young people recognise that the education system as it currently stands is not aware of, or informed by smart energy technologies and iii) that despite being a generation that is the most integrated with personal assistance technology, these young people have significant concerns over the reliability and safety of AI in SLES. These findings are set alongside calls for widespread education in key stages 4 and 5 (ages 14-18) around the subject of SLES, and their benefits to wider society, thereby enabling a future that empowers young people to make change, encourage engineering and computer science-based career options and secure a fairer, cleaner, sustainable energy transition in the future."}

The conventional approach for obtaining the WHR entails manual measurement, which necessitates experienced anthropometrists to measure the waist and hip circumferences of a subject wearing tight clothing in a predetermined posture, and subsequently calculate the ratio based on the acquired measurements. WHR errors may be accumulated due to the anthropometrist’s subjectivity, as well as the person’s pose and attire during the measurement process. Non-contact anthropometric measurements using 3D scanning technology have shown promise in providing higher accuracy and faster measurement compared to traditional methods. However, they require complete undressed body scans as input, which is not always available. In this paper, we proposed, to the best of our knowledge, the first deep learning-based algorithm, dubbed W2H-Net, to predict the WHR directly from single partial dressed body scans in arbitrary postures. W2H-Net introduces a novel framework called FocusNet to improve learning accuracy by selectively focusing on parts that require attention. W2H-Net provides a flexible, cost-effective, and privacy-preserving way to obtain accurate WHR measurements, which are crucial for predicting health risks associated with central obesity.

However, most enhancement strategies for PSO, including the existing diversity-guided strategies, have not fully addressed this issue. This paper proposes the virtual position guided (VPG) strategy for PSO algorithms. The VPG strategy calculates diversity values for two different populations and establishes a diversity baseline. It then dynamically guides the algorithm to conduct different search behaviors, through three phases - divergence, normal, and acceleration - in each iteration, based on the relationships among these diversity values and the baseline. Collectively, these phases orchestrate different schemes to balance exploration and exploitation, collaboratively steering the algorithm away from local optima and towards enhanced solution quality. The introduction of ‘virtual position’ caters to the strategy's adaptability across various PSO algorithms, ensuring the generality and effectiveness of the proposed VPG strategy. With a single hyperparameter and a recommended usual setup, VPG is easy to implement. The experimental results demonstrate that the VPG strategy is superior to several canonical and the state-of-the-art strategies for diversity guidance, and is effective in improving the search performance of most PSO algorithms on multimodal problems of various dimensionalities."}

The emerging field of graph signal processing (GSP) promises to analyse spectral characteristics of these multivariate signals, while also taking the spatial structure between the time signals into account. A core idea in GSP is the graph Fourier transform, which projects a multivariate signal onto frequency-ordered graph Fourier modes and can be regarded as a spatial analogue of the classical Fourier transform. This chapter derives and discusses key concepts in GSP, with a specific focus on understanding the differences between parallel formulations and the interconnections between the various concepts. The experimental section focuses on the role of graph frequency in data classification, with applications to neuroimaging. To shed light on graph frequencies individually, sample sizes larger than those of relevant empirical data sets are needed. We therefore introduce a minimalist simulation to generate sufficiently many signals, which share key characteristics with neurophysiological signals. Using this artificial data, we find that higher graph frequency signals are more suitable for classification as compared to lower graph frequency signals and propose GSP mechanisms to explain our findings. Finally, we present a baseline testing framework for GSP. Using this framework, our results suggest that GSP may be applicable for dimensionality reduction in neurophysiological signals."}

Traditional surrogate models, which provide an efficient approximation of the underlying expensive model, exemplified by the Gaussian process (GP), encounter limitations in accurately capturing the non-Gaussian nature inherent in the input/output relationship. Such limitations restrict their applicability to simpler problems. Furthermore, the applicability of newer hybrid surrogates, such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), for uncertainty quantification (UQ) is hindered by the significant computational cost of quantifying uncertainty, which requires a large number of parameters to optimise.\nThis research addresses these challenges by leveraging an efficient non-linear GP model known as the deep Gaussian process (deep GP), which is designed to the complexities of deep learning and modelling high-dimensional complex systems. This model is structured with multiple hidden layers interconnected by non-linear mappings. We explore the applicability of deep Gaussian processes, including their adaptation to replace a complex numerical model that solves the Navier–Stokes equations to model the hydro-morphodynamics around mangrove environments, and development of a novel UQ and uncertainty for deep GP for this high-resolution complex model. The derived findings reveal that the deep GP exhibits remarkable improvements in efficiency, significantly surpassing the baseline UQ method in terms of computational time and accuracy level. Concurrently, it demonstrates an accuracy improvement of over 5 orders of magnitude when contrasted with the standard GP model. Moreover, the deep GP exhibits superior robustness in quantifying uncertainty amidst diverse spatio-temporal complexities compared to its GP counterpart. This research significantly advances the understanding and application of uncertainty quantification in the field of hydro-morphodynamics with significant real-world implications for climate change adaptation and protection mitigation decisions."}

We find the transformer can outperform these guards, gaining up to 30% accuracy and 70% precision. We further show that the inference time of the transformer is inconsequential which shows that it is well-suited to include as a guard in a CAS. Furthermore, we use Layer Integrated Gradients to interpret the decisions that the transformer is making.

We show theoretically how the model can be used to directly compute the diffusion-based connectivity structure from multivariate signals. Unlike other connectivity measures, our heat model-based approach is inherently multivariate and yields an absolute scaling factor, namely the graph thermal diffusivity, which captures the extent of heat-like graph propagation in the data. On two datasets, we show how the graph thermal diffusivity can be used to characterise Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We find that the graph thermal diffusivity is lower for AD patients than healthy controls and correlates with mini–mental state examination (MMSE) scores, suggesting structural impairment in patients in line with previous findings.Clinical relevance— This study introduces a novel heat-based connectivity measure, which allows to characterise Alzheimer’s disease in terms of the graph thermal diffusivity."}

Our methodology is structured into three fundamental components: the first part involves the Res2Net-based encoder, followed by the second part, which encompasses the fusion layer, and finally, the third part, which comprises the decoder. The encoder based on Res2Net is utilized for extracting multi-scale features from the input image. Simultaneously, with a single image as input, we introduce a pioneering training strategy tailored for a Res2Net-based encoder. We further enhance the fusion process with a novel strategy based on the attention model, ensuring precise reconstruction by the decoder for the fused image. Experimental results unequivocally showcase our method’s unparalleled fusion performance, surpassing existing techniques, as evidenced by rigorous subjective and objective evaluations."}

This study addresses this gap by analysing various light properties' effects (photoperiod, intensity, ratio, light-dark order) on Arabidopsis thaliana growth using days-to-flower (DTF) and hypocotyl length as proxies to measure plant growth and development. After establishing suitable ranges through a comprehensive literature review, these properties varied within those ranges. Compared to white light, a 16-h cycle of blue light reduces DTF and hypocotyl length by 12 % and 3 %, respectively. Interestingly, similar results can be achieved using a shorter photoperiod of 14-h light (composed of 8 h of a mixture of 66.7 μmol m-2s-1 red and 800 μmol m-2s-1 blue lights (i.e. blue:red ratio of 12:1) followed by 6 h of monochromatic red light and 10-h dark. These findings offer potential for efficient growth light recipes in smart greenhouse farming, optimizing productivity while minimizing energy consumption."}

Although high-resolution flood simulations have made notable advancements, they remain computationally expensive, underscoring the need for efficient machine learning surrogate models. As a result of sparse empirical observation and expensive data collection, there is a growing need for the models to perform effectively in ‘small-data’ contexts, a characteristic typical of many scientific problems. This research combines the latest developments in surrogate modelling and physics-informed machine learning to propose a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network-based surrogate model for hydrodynamic simulators governed by Shallow Water Equations. The proposed method incorporates physics-based prior information into the neural network structure by encoding the conservation of mass into the model without relying on calculating continuous derivatives in the loss function. The method is demonstrated for a high-resolution inland flood simulation model and a large-scale regional tidal model. The proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art data-driven approaches by up to 25 %. This research demonstrates the benefits and robustness of physics-informed approaches in surrogate modelling for flood and hydroclimatic modelling problems."}

To address this, we provide a nonperturbative theory of the L-H transition by stochastic simulations of a reduced L-H transition model and detailed statistical analysis. By calculating time-dependent probability density functions (PDFs) of turbulence, zonal flows, and the mean pressure gradient, we elucidate how statistical properties change over time with the help of the information geometry theory (information rate, causal information rate), highlighting its utility in capturing self-regulation and causal relation among turbulence, zonal flow shears, and the mean flow shears.

Accordingly, this review is intended to provide adequate coverage of the problems affecting autonomous vehicles in this area, by examining the most recent methods for mapping and localization as well as related feature extraction and data security problems. First, a discussion of the contemporary methods of extracting relevant features from equipped sensors and their categorization as semantic, non-semantic, and deep learning methods is presented. We conclude that representativeness, low cost, and accessibility are crucial constraints in the choice of the methods to be adopted for localization and mapping tasks. Second, the survey focuses on methods to build a vehicle’s environment map, considering both the commercial and the academic solutions available. The analysis proposes a difference between two types of environment, known and unknown, and develops solutions in each case. Third, the survey explores different approaches to vehicle localization and also classifies them according to their mathematical characteristics and priorities. Each section concludes by presenting the related challenges and some future directions. The article also highlights the security problems likely to be encountered in self-driving vehicles, with an assessment of possible defense mechanisms that could prevent security attacks in vehicles. Finally, the article ends with a debate on the potential impacts of autonomous driving, spanning energy consumption and emission reduction, sound and light pollution, integration into smart cities, infrastructure optimization, and software refinement.

In response to the absence of immediate expert feedback on performed actions, developing a Human Action Evaluation (HAE) system emerges as a valuable automated solution, addressing the need for accurate assessment of exercises and guidance during physical rehabilitation. Previous HAE systems developed for the rehabilitation exercises have focused on developing models that utilize skeleton data as input to compute a quality score for each action performed by the patient. However, existing studies have focused on improving scoring performance while often overlooking computational efficiency. In this research, we propose LightPRA (Light Physical Rehabilitation Assessment) system, an innovative architectural solution based on a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), which harnesses the capabilities of dilated causal Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This approach efficiently captures complex temporal features and characteristics of the skeleton data with lower computational complexity, making it suitable for real-time feedback provided on resource-constrained devices such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices and Edge computing frameworks. Through empirical analysis performed on the University of Idaho-Physical Rehabilitation Movement Data (UI-PRMD) and KInematic assessment of MOvement for remote monitoring of physical REhabilitation (KIMORE) datasets, our proposed LightPRA model demonstrates superior performance over several state-of-the-art approaches such as Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based models in scoring human activity performance, while exhibiting lower computational cost and complexity."}

We consider the theory of non-linear real arithmetic where the formulae are logical combinations of polynomial constraints. Here a commonly used tool is the cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) to decompose the real space into cells where the constraints are truth-invariant through the use of projection polynomials.\nA CAD encodes more information than necessary for checking satisfiability. One approach to address this is to repackage the CAD theory into a search-based algorithm: one that guesses sample points to satisfy the formula, and generalizes guesses that conflict constraints to cylindrical cells around samples which are avoided in the continuing search. This can lead to a satisfying assignment more quickly, or conclude unsatisfiability with far fewer cells. A notable example of this approach is Jovanović and de Moura's NLSAT algorithm. Since these cells are being produced locally to a sample there is scope to use fewer projection polynomials than the traditional CAD projection. The original NLSAT algorithm reduced the set a little; while Brown's single cell construction reduced it much further still. However, it refines a cell polynomial-by-polynomial, meaning the shape and size of the cell produced depends on the order in which the polynomials are considered.\nThe present paper proposes a method to construct such cells levelwise, i.e. built level-by-level according to a variable ordering instead of polynomial-by-polynomial for all levels. We still use a reduced number of projection polynomials, but can now consider a variety of different reductions and use heuristics to select the projection polynomials in order to optimize the shape of the cell under construction. The new method can thus improve the performance of the NLSAT algorithm. We formulate all the necessary theory that underpins the algorithm as a proof system: while not a common presentation for work in this field, it is valuable in allowing an elegant decoupling of heuristic decisions from the main algorithm and its proof of correctness. We expect the symbolic computation community may find uses for it in other areas too. In particular, the proof system could be a step towards formal proofs for non-linear real arithmetic.\nThis work has been implemented in the SMT-RAT solver and the benefits of the levelwise construction are validated experimentally on the SMT-LIB benchmark library. We also compare several heuristics for the construction and observe that each heuristic has strengths offering potential for further exploitation of the new approach."}

We present results for a particular case study, the selection of variable ordering for cylindrical algebraic decomposition, but expect that the lessons learned are applicable to other decisions in symbolic computation. We utilise an existing dataset of examples derived from applications which was found to be imbalanced with respect to the variable ordering decision. We introduce an augmentation technique for polynomial systems problems that allows us to balance and further augment the dataset, improving the machine learning results by 28% and 38% on average, respectively. We then demonstrate how the existing machine learning methodology used for the problem—classification—might be recast into the regression paradigm. While this does not have a radical change on the performance, it does widen the scope in which the methodology can be applied to make choices."}

To be specific, representative anchor points are selected for each view to construct corresponding anchor representation matrices, and all views' anchor points are utilized to construct a common representation matrix. Using anchor points also reduces the computation complexity. Next, the bipartite graph is built by fusing these representation matrices, and a Laplacian rank constraint is enforced on the bipartite graph. This will make the bipartite graph have k connected components to obtain accurate clustering labels, where the bipartite graph is specifically designed for a large-scale dataset problem. In addition, the anchor points are also updated by dictionary learning. The experimental results on the four benchmark image processing datasets have demonstrated superior performance of the proposed large-scale multi-view clustering algorithm over other state-of-the-art multi-view clustering algorithms.

The evolution of ANNs during training is studied by looking at the probability distribution of its parameters. Information geometry utilizing the principles of differential geometry, offers a unique perspective on probability and statistics by considering probability density functions as points on a Riemannian manifold. We create this manifold using a metric based on Fisher information to define a distance and a velocity.

Utilizing standard datasets like MNIST, FMNIST and CIFAR-10, we observe a transition in the motion on the manifold while training the ANN and this transition is identified with over-fitting in the ANN models considered. The information geometric transitions observed is shown to be mathematically similar to the phase transitions in physics. Preliminary results showing finite-size scaling behavior is also provided.

This is primarily due to critical research gaps in novel textile structure design for seamless integration with sensing elements. Here, an all-in-one biaxial insertion knit architecture is reported to topologically integrate sensing units within double-knit loops for the fabrication of a large-scale tactile sensing textile by using low-cost industrial manufacturing routes. High sensitivity, stability, and low hysteresis of arrayed sensing units are achieved through engineering of fractal structures of hierarchically patterned piezoresistive yarns via blistering and twisting processing. The as-prepared tactile sensing textiles show desirable sensing performance and robust mechanical property, while ensuring excellent conformability, tailorability, breathability (288 mm s ), and moisture permeability (3591 g m per day) for minimizing the effect on wearing comfort. The multifunctional applications of tactile sensing textiles are demonstrated in continuously monitoring human motions, tactile interactions with the environment, and recognizing biometric gait. Moreover, we also demonstrate that machine learning-assisted sensing textiles can accurately predict body postures, which holds great promise in advancing the development of personalized healthcare robotics, prosthetics, and intelligent interaction devices."}

In this paper, we propose a novel Graphical Consensus-based Sharding (GCS) framework, which is underpinned by four important strategies: 1) A graphical consensus is adopted as its intra-shard consensus, where the consensus group is set up according to its maximal connected subgraph, and the leader is elected by its reliability weight. The consensus group is refreshed intermittently by alternating the leader role. 2) Within GCS, the intra-shard data are stored in the local chain, while a block-based directed acyclic graph, rather than a chained structure, is employed as the main chain. The local chain is used to respond to requests within each shard, and the main chain supports the cross-shard sharings. GCS will parallelly optimize the throughput of the blockchain-enabled Internet of Vehicles. 3) GCS further introduces the shard backup and the node scheduling to handle shard failure and overheating by using new backup strategies and a temporal-spatial graph convolutional network prediction model, respectively. 4) An off-chain transmission algorithm is presented for secure sharing between the infrastructure and the vehicles.

Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used approach for model compression. However, when applied in the object detection problems, the existing KD methods either directly applies the feature map or simply separate the foreground from the background by using a binary mask, aligning the attention between the teacher and the student models. Unfortunately, these methods either completely overlook or fail to thoroughly eliminate noise, resulting in unsatisfactory model accuracy for student models. To address this issue, we propose a foreground separation distillation (FSD) method in this paper. The FSD method enables student models to distinguish between foreground and background using Gaussian heatmaps, reducing irrelevant information in the learning process. Additionally, FSD also extracts the channel feature by converting the spatial feature maps into probabilistic forms to fully utilize the knowledge in each channel of a well-trained teacher. Experimental results demonstrate that the YOLOX detector enhanced with our distillation method achieved superior performance on both the fall detection and the VOC2007 datasets. For example, YOLOX with FSD achieved 73.1% mean average precision (mAP) on the Fall Detection dataset, which is 1.6% higher than the baseline.

ML approaches can offer a fast, low-cost alternative to short-term forecasting than expensive numerical simulation while addressing a significant outstanding limitation of numerical modelling by being able to robustly and dynamically quantify predictive uncertainty. Low-cost and near-instantaneous forecasting of high-level climate variables has clear applications in early warning systems, nowcasting, and parameterising small-scale locally relevant simulations. This paper presents a novel approach for multi-task spatiotemporal regression by combining data-driven autoencoders with Gaussian Processes (GP) to produce a probabilistic tensor-based regression model. The proposed method is demonstrated for forecasting one-step-ahead temperature and pressure on a global scale simultaneously. By conducting probabilistic regression in the learned latent space, samples can be propagated back to the original feature space to produce uncertainty estimates at a vastly reduced computational cost. The composite GP-autoencoder model was able to simultaneously forecast global temperature and pressure values with average errors of 3.82 °C and 638 hPa, respectively. Further, on average the true values were within the proposed posterior distribution 95.6% of the time illustrating that the model produces a well-calibrated predictive posterior distribution."}

This paper focuses on the application of fine-grained sentiment analysis in financial distress prediction (FDP) to enhance early warnings of the management status of companies. In previous studies, there has been a narrow emphasis on using document-level sentiment analysis to extract overall sentiment from text, overlooking the semantic nuances conveyed by sentiments. Therefore, this paper aims to extract fine-grained sentiments from the Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A) of Chinese listed companies. The proposed model is based on a two-step framework, consisting of an unsupervised aspect-level financial sentiment extraction phase and a model validation phase. Specifically, the former is built on a deep learning model with an attention mechanism, conducting unsupervised aspect extraction, aspect identification, and aspect-level sentiment classification in a sequential manner to obtain fine-grained sentiments. The latter is responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of the newly acquired features on benchmark machine learning models, including SVM, DT, LR, CNN, and DNN. Experimental results reveal that MD&A predominantly covers eight types of aspects, including ownership, business scope, development, capital, sales, management, prizes, and probability. Additionally, it has been observed that fine-grained sentiment features can enhance the performance of FDP. This study represents a significant innovation in existing literature, being the first to introduce aspect-level financial sentiment analysis into the realm of FDP."}

The particular focus of this study is on addressing the scarcity of labelled images. This paper introduces several contributions, including a systematic satellite image data augmentation approach that aims to maintain data population consistency during model training, thus mitigating performance degradation. To alleviate the labour-intensive task of pixel-wise image labelling, we present a novel application of a modified conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) to generate artificial satellite images and corresponding farm labels. Additionally, we scrutinize the role of spectral bands in satellite image segmentation and compare two prominent semantic segmentation models, U-Net and DeepLabV3+, with diverse backbone structures. Our empirical findings demonstrate that augmenting the dataset with up to 22.85% artificial samples significantly enhances the model performance. Notably, the U-Net model, employing standard convolution, outperforms the DeepLabV3+ models with atrous convolution, achieving a segmentation accuracy of 86.92% on the test data."}

We propose a modification to the TFC framework named Reduced TFC and show a significant improvement in the training and inference time of PINNs compared to IBCs imposed using TFC. Furthermore, Reduced TFC is shown to be able to generalize to more complex boundary geometries which is not possible with TFC. We also introduce a method of applying boundary conditions at infinity for BVPs and numerically solve the pure advection in 1+1 D Euler equations using these boundary conditions."}

They provide high melting/heating rates with optimal efficiency. The occurrence of faults not only imposes safety risks but also reduces productivity due to unscheduled shutdowns. The problem of diagnosing faults in induction furnaces has not yet been studied, and this work is the first to propose a data-driven framework for diagnosing faults in this application. This paper presents a deep neural network framework for diagnosing electrical faults by measuring real-time electrical parameters at the supply side. Experimental and sensory measurements are collected from multiple energy analyzer devices installed in the foundry. Next, a semi-supervised learning approach, known as the local outlier factor, has been used to discriminate normal and faulty samples from each other and label the data samples. Then, a deep neural network is trained with the collected labeled samples. The performance of the developed model is compared with several state-of-the-art techniques in terms of various performance metrics. The results demonstrate the superior performance of the selected deep neural network model over other classifiers, with an average F-measure of 0.9187. Due to the black box nature of the constructed neural network, the model predictions are interpreted by Shapley additive explanations and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations. The interpretability analysis reveals that classified faults are closely linked to variations in odd voltage/current harmonics of order 3, 11, 13, and 17, highlighting the critical impact of these parameters on the model’s prediction."}

We present a case study on the use of ML to select the variable ordering for cylindrical algebraic decomposition. It has already been demonstrated that ML can make the choice well, but here we show how the SHAP tool for explainability can be used to inform new heuristics of a size and complexity similar to those human-designed heuristics currently commonly used in symbolic computation."}

In fact, no single modeling option universally excels on all citation function classes or annotation schemes, which implies the untapped potential for synergizing diverse modeling approaches to further elevate the performance of citation context analysis. Motivated by this insight, the current paper undertook a systematic exploration of ensemble methods for citation context analysis. To achieve a better diverse set of base classifiers, we delved into three sources of classifier diversity, incorporated five diversity measures, and introduced two novel diversity re-ranking methods. Then, we conducted a comprehensive examination of both voting and stacking approaches for constructing classifier ensembles. We also proposed a novel weighting method that considers each individual classifier’s performance, resulting in superior voting outcomes. While being simple, voting approaches faced significant challenges in determining the optimal number of base classifiers for combination. Several strategies have been proposed to address this limitation, including meta-classification on base classifiers and utilising deeper ensemble architectures. The latter involved hierarchical voting on a filtered set of meta-classifiers and stacked meta-classification. All proposed methods demonstrate state-of-the-art results on, with the best performances achieving more than 5% and 4% improvements on the 11-class and 6-class schemes of citation function classification and by 3% on important citation screening. The promising empirical results validated the potential of our ensembling approaches for citation context analysis."}

Combined with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), artificial intelligence, and computer vision, SAR operations can be revolutionized through enabling rescuers to expand ground coverage with improved detection accuracy whilst reducing costs and personal injury risks. However, detecting small objects is one of the significant challenges associated with using computer vision on UAVs. Several approaches have been proposed for improving small object detection, including data augmentation techniques like replication and variation of image sizes, but their suitability for SAR application characteristics remains questionable. To address these issues, this paper evaluates four float detection algorithms against the baseline and augmented datasets to improve float detection for maritime SAR. Results demonstrated that YOLOv8 and YOLOv5 outperformed the others in which F1 scores ranged from 82.9 to 95.3%, with an enhancement range of 0.1–29.2%.

In this study, we comprehensively explored the potential early detection of gout flares (GFs) based on nurses’ chief complaint notes in the Emergency Department (ED). Addressing the challenge of identifying GFs prospectively during an ED visit, where documentation is typically minimal, our research focused on employing alternative Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to enhance detection accuracy. We investigated GF detection algorithms using both sparse representations by traditional NLP methods and dense encodings by medical domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs), distinguishing between generative and discriminative models. Three methods were used to alleviate the issue of severe data imbalances, including oversampling, class weights, and focal loss. Extensive empirical studies were performed on the Gout Emergency Department Chief Complaint Corpora. Sparse text representations like tf-idf proved to produce strong performances, achieving F1 scores higher than 0.75. The best deep learning models were RoBERTa-large-PM-M3-Voc and BioGPT, which had the best F1 scores for each dataset, with a 0.8 on the 2019 dataset and a 0.85 F1 score on the 2020 dataset, respectively. We concluded that although discriminative LLMs performed better for this classification task when compared to generative LLMs, a combination of using generative models as feature extractors and employing a support vector machine for classification yielded promising results comparable to those obtained with discriminative models."}

However, the automatic detection of diabetic retinopathy through medical image processing requires a large number of training data to build a model with good performance. This poses a challenge when working with small datasets as these models need large datasets to perform well on unseen data. In this paper, we design a few-shot Siamese Neural Networks combined with pre-trained models, such as VGG16, ResNet50, and DenseNet121, to effectively differentiate between classes using small lesions in the retinal images. The proposed model is trained based on the similarity between the pair of images using a comparatively small dataset and performs well for a five-class classification problem. We use the Fine-Grained Annotated Diabetic Retinopathy (FGADR) and APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection dataset, where a small ratio of training images is used to train the model. To evaluate our model, we conduct the testing on the remaining data and achieve good accuracy when trained on limited images, with fewer epochs and fewer parameters. The proposed model achieves high accuracy rates on five-class classification of 80% on FGADR and 81% on APTOS 2019 datasets, with a consistent quadratic weighted kappa (QWK) score of 0.89 across both datasets. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of hyperparameter optimisation, specifically investigating different pair selection techniques, loss functions, and distance layers to thoroughly evaluate their impact on the performance of the model. Our proposed model demonstrates promising results when combined with an attention mechanism to perform multiclass classification of diabetic retinopathy using a limited number of eye fundus images, outperforming existing approaches with only a small number of epochs in training."}

Our research offers a novel, affordable visualization method that aims to transform the way we examine and interpret flow dynamics in response to these challenges. Our method is developed to utilize a low-cost camera system with a simple laser setup to investigate fluid dynamics inside pipes.

To address these issues, we propose an ECPE Pair Generator (ECPE-PG), with a Clause-Encoder layer, a Pre-Output layer and an Information Interaction-based Pair Generation (IIPG) Module embedded. This model first encodes clauses into vector representations through the Clause-Encoder layer and then preforms emotion clause extraction (EE), cause clause extraction (CE) and emotion type extraction (ETE), respectively, through the Pre-Output layer, on the basis of which the IIPG module analyzes the complex emotional logic of relationships between clauses and estimates the candidate pairs based on the interaction of global and local information. It should be noted that emotion type information is regarded as a crucial indication in the IIPG module to assist the identification of emotion-cause pairs.

Thus, they do not significantly improve the reliability under bursty channels while increasing the energy consumption with multiple retransmissions. Our proposed method utilises Reinforcement Learning (RL) to develop an adaptive retransmission strategy. This strategy is informed by analysing the transmission history of the sensor. The RL algorithm learns the optimal policy, which maximises energy efficiency and Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) in networks with burst channel errors. Our RL retransmission strategy performed better in PDR and energy efficiency than the IEEE 802.15.4 and\nRetransmission Adaptive Intelligence Medium Access Control (RAI-MAC) proposed in the literature.

Accordingly, the contributions of this paper focus on training neural networks using a pre-trained language model for predicting sibling relationships between cybersecurity vulnerabilities, then outlining how to apply this predictive model towards the generation of hierarchical attack models. In addition, two data sampling mechanisms for tackling data complexity and a consensus mechanism for reducing the amount of false positive predictions are outlined. Each of these approaches is compared and contrasted using empirical results from three sets of cybersecurity data to determine their effectiveness."}

The #EndSARS movement in Nigeria started in 2017 as a citizen-led effort that confronted police brutality, especially from the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) of the Nigerian Police. Facilitated primarily by social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp, data shows that more than 8 million unique authors participated in creating content that commented on or provided support to the offline protests (NENDO 2020). Much like other contemporary social media activism efforts, #EndSARS lacked established and movement-recognised spokespersons; instead, networked microcelebrities and influential voices emerged intermittently, each with varied social capital, reflecting the movement's decentralised nature. This paper presents research into the lived experiences of #EndSARS activists on Instagram, utilising a modified social network analysis to identify these individuals without relying on popularity metrics alone. Adopting a postcolonial lens, this research centred on inclusive representation to disrupt traditional hierarchies where dominant voices speak over, or on behalf of, marginalised communities. This approach was implemented through Richardson's (2000) crystallisation and by operationalising Tufekci's (2013) concept of the \"networked microcelebrity\". Standard social network analysis metrics were adapted to recognise diverse voices and multifaceted connections among activists. The resulting visualisation platform highlights interactions among 117 information-rich participants, offering multidirectional perspectives on the movement's narrative. This approach enhanced the visibility of less-prominent activists and provided a nuanced, visually engaging map of the networked narratives driving #EndSARS. In a broader context, this approach initiates the conversation on decolonising social network analysis to incorporate more diverse and representative voices."}

To ensure safe and efficient operation, a novel, robust and adaptive control strategy is employed using a two-stage recursive least squares based estimation, combined with an auto-tuning mixed-sensitivity H∞ controller. A numerical simulation demonstrates fast and accurate real-time estimation of actuator loss of effectiveness and changes in the mass and inertia due to payload pickup/drop-off during delivery missions. The combined and uneven effects of multiple faults with initial mass and inertia uncertainties are efficiently compensated by this novel fault tolerant flight control strategy. The controller also improves the rejection of these uncertainties during the transient stage before the convergence of the parameter estimation. The proposed approach maintains the operational reliability of delivery quadcopters under a range of challenging uneven faults and significant mass and inertia uncertainties."}

This paper reports a probabilistic theory of the L-H transition, in particular, a probability density function of power threshold Qc for the first time. Specifically, by utilizing a stochastic prey-predator model with energy-conserving zonal flow-turbulence interactions and extensive GPU computing, we investigate the effects of stochastic noises, external perturbations, time-dependent input power ramping, and initial conditions on the power threshold uncertainty. The information geometry theory (information rate, causal information rate) is employed to highlight how statistical properties of turbulence, zonal flows, and mean pressure gradient change over the transition, clarifying self-regulation and causal relations among them."}

To achieve this, several tools, leveraging constraint-based stoichiometric models and metaheuristic algorithms like particle swarm optimization (PSO), have been developed. However, PSO can potentially get trapped in local optima. Quantum-behaved PSO (QPSO) overcomes this limitation, and our study further enhances its binary version (BQPSO) with a neighborhood topology, leading to the advanced neighborhood-based BQPSO (NBQPSO). Combined with flux balance analysis (FBA), this forms an innovative approach, NBQPSO-FBA, for identifying optimal knockout strategies to maximize the desired metabolite production. Additionally, we introduced a novel encoding strategy suitable for large-scale genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs). Evaluated on four E. coli GSMMs (iJR904, iAF1260, iJO1366, and iML1515), NBQPSO-FBA matches or surpasses established bi-level linear programming (LP) and heuristic methods in metabolite production optimization. Notably, it achieved 90.69% realization of the theoretical maximum in acetate production and demonstrated comparable performance with leading algorithms in lactate production. The efficiency of NBQPSO-FBA, which requires fewer knockouts, makes it a practical and effective tool for optimizing microbial cell factories. This addresses the rising demand for microbial products across various industries."}

Duncan", "Vasile Palade"], "author_urls": ["https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/michael-duncan/", "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/vasile-palade/"], "abstract": "Evaluating deep squats accurately during automatic physical rehabilitation monitoring across different subjects remains challenging due to inter-subject variability and limited labelled data. The challenges include: 1) conventional methods presuppose that a \"one-model-fits-all\"approach works for activity evaluation, ignoring that subject-specific differences can lead to suboptimal results if these differences are not considered. 2) Previous studies focus on offline learning, where models are trained on the entire dataset, which can be updated later through retraining. This approach neglects the need for continual learning, where models adapt sequentially to new subjects while retaining past knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a novel continual meta-learning approach and a memory buffer to provide personalized deep squat evaluations. Using Azure Kinect sensors, we collected RGB-D videos and 3D skeletal data from 33 participants performing deep squats, annotated with Functional Movement Screen (FMS) scores. Our model dynamically adapts to new participants while retaining knowledge from previous ones, preventing performance degradation over time. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms a model without a buffer memory technique by retaining learned knowledge across participants and adapting to new individuals with minimal data."}

Despite substantial progress, the practical application of e‐textiles in wearable technologies remains limited by challenging tasks of integrating both optimal electrical performance and thermal‐moisture comfort into a single fabric, particularly at industrial scales. Herein, leveraging a meta‐textile structural design, a smart treble‐weaving electronic textile (TWET) that combines highly sensitive sensing capabilities with radiative cooling is developed and enhanced sweat management through meta‐yarn junction blocks forming hierarchical fabric architectures. Unlike conventional layered fabrics by simply compositing different functional layers, the TWET fabric integrates multimodal sensing, optical and moisture management into an all‐in‐one construction and leverages its interlacing structures as conduits for heat and moisture transmission, which contributes to outstanding thermal‐moisture comfort. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the TWET performs robust monitoring and perception of human motion signals against heat stress. It is also shown that frequency‐domain signals resulting from Fourier transformation can interpret and distinguish temporal‐spatial features of regulating walking and stepping in place. This meta‐textile hierarchical‐assembly concept enables integrated thermal and moisture management in next‐generation e‐textiles, offering great potential for scalable production and multifunctionality through the precise engineering of meta‐structures."}

Our research focuses on gender bias in Nepali-English machine translation, an area that has seen little exploration. With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLM), there is a unique opportunity to mitigate these biases. In this study, we quantify and evaluate gender bias by constructing an occupation corpus and adapting three gender-bias challenge sets for Nepali. Our findings reveal that gender bias is prevalent in existing translation systems, with translations often reinforcing stereotypes and misrepresenting gender-specific roles. However, LLMs perform significantly better in both gender-neutral and gender-specific contexts, demonstrating less bias compared to traditional machine translation systems. Despite some quirks, LLMs offer a promising alternative for culture-rich, low-resource languages like Nepali. We also explore how LLMs can improve gender accuracy and mitigate biases in occupational terms, providing a more equitable translation experience. Our work contributes to the growing effort to reduce biases in machine translation and highlights the potential of LLMs to address bias in low-resource languages, paving the way for more inclusive and accurate translation systems."}
